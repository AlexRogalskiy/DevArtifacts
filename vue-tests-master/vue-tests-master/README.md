# Vue JS Unit Tests

This project contains a unit test for a simple to do list component. The project was set up using vue-cli and the tests are made with Mocha framework and run using Karma.

When the app is running, you can navigate to localhost:8080/#/to-do to find the page for the to do list.

I explain how the test works in my blog post: https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-write-a-unit-test-for-vuejs

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
