<h1>My summer vacation</h1>
<main>
<p>This summer I went to Camp Smurfabunch. I was there for 2 weeks and had mega fun times. I was the fastest kayaker in the whole camp and won a first place ribbon. I learned to tie knots, dive off a pier, and lick toads.</p>
  
<p>I met new friends Ketchel, Caleb, and Sarah. I hope they come visit me later this summer but even if they can't &mdash; I'll see them next summer.</p>

<hr>

<p>Later that summer I got to go to Wisconsin Dells with my family. We stayed at The Wilderness which has both inside and outside water parks. My mom was scared to go down the four-person funnel ride, but she did anyway and ended up liking it.</p>

<p>We went go karting at Mt. Zues (or something, I can't remember the name but there was an old god dude holding a lightning bolt as the logo). I beat my brother and dad on the first 2 laps but dad pulled ahead and beat me on the last lap.</p>

<hr>

<p>The last thing I did this summer was go shopping for school clothes and supplies. I got a Trapper Keeper with KISS on it. And like fifty erasers because I make mistakes a lot lololol.</p>

<p>I don't want to go back to school but I know once I get used to it, it will be fine again. I'd rather just go down waterslides all day.</p>
