          <p>
            Even if you get most of your business via word of mouth, there are still people searching for the services that you offer in your area and if your website isn't there to guide them to your store, they will be directed somewhere else. Expose your amazing service to a whole demographic that may not know how to find you.

          <h2>A website for your small business makes you look BIG!</h2>
          <p>
            It doesn't matter if your in the penthouse suite or the garage, a beautiful website shows customers the professional side of your business. Even in the construction and service industries, a typical new client will check your small business website before making a decision to even set up an appointment for an estimate. Have them already confident in your company before they ever pick up the phone or send an email.

          <h2>Run effective marketing campaigns in your sleep.</h2>
          <p>
          When something exciting happens, let the world know. Target only certain clients for certain sales. Keep track and stay in touch with customers who haven't come back in awhile, ask them how they have been and let them know about what is new with your services. Allow customers to share how much they love your website with their friends. Just as word of mouth is a great advertiser in the real world, it is even more powerful on the internet where people can inform all their friends and family how great you are with one click!

          <h2>A website is the All-in-one tool for building business.</h2>
          <!--<h3>Save time</h3>
          <p>
            When you are busy it isn't always a great time to answer questions from prospective clients. A great website will not only help inform potential customers about your services, but also answer commonly asked questions and demonstrate the value of your work through testimonials. A well made site can help tire kickers make a decision without you ever having to spend time speaking with them, leaving free time to handle more important tasks.
          </p>
          <h3>Save money</h3>
          <p>
            The best thing is you don't have to pay to post a sale on your site, it costs the same to send one email as it does to send 100 or a 1,000. A great website scales with your business, as your business grows and your website becomes more popular it becomes more powerful and it doesn't cost you any extra. Your website can be used to market new products, keep in touch with clients, promote services, showcase your latest work and demonstrate your value to a whole new online community.
          </p>
          <h3>Make money</h3>
          <p>
              You can sell your product online even when your not at work. If your product isn't sell-able over the internet (which most are) your website is still a great place to show off what you know and what you have done in your industry. By proving that you are an expert in your field you'll be guaranteed to pull in more business. Most great businessmen know that building confidence in your brand puts the customers mind at ease and gets clients to feel confident as well spending money with you.
