# modelFactory 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Swimlane/angular-model-factory.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Swimlane/model-factory)

A light-weight model layer that bridges the gap between AngularJS and your RESTful APIs.

Why would you use this over other available solutions?

- Lightweight/Simple, the code simply does some basic copy/extending and prototypical instances; no magic required.
- Patterns/Practices, the model definition closely resembles Angular's ngResource meaning its easy to swap out, replace later, eases scaling/transition, and its designed for Angular; not a backbone port!
- Utilizes Angular at the core, it doesn't duplicate things Angular already does.  Any action can be passed a `$http` configuration option, all your interceptors still work, it uses Angular's cache, etc!
- Compliant, URI Template matches the specs.
- Small - 1.45KB gzipped/minified ( excludes depedencies )
- Minimal Dependencies, only use URI template and deep-diff ( this isn't even required ) utility.  NO underscore, lodash, jquery, etc!
- Its full of awesome features


See [wiki](https://github.com/Swimlane/model-factory/wiki) for documentation.


## Features

- URI Templates (RFC6570)
- Model instances
- Collections
- Single Datastore
- Caching / Cache invalidation
- Default value population
- Pending / Completed Status
- Relationships
- Object Deep Diff / Reversion
- Track active promises to prevent duplicate sends


## Other Solutions

After doing quite a bit of research before writing this, I took a look at other solutions.  Here is what I found and why I wrote my own.

- [Restmod](https://github.com/platanus/angular-restmod)
Very nice solution but very opinionated and hyper-active. 22kb min

- [Modelizer](https://github.com/VasilioRuzanni/angular-modelizer)
Good but requires Lodash. 23kb min

- [ModelCore](https://github.com/klederson/ModelCore/)
Good but not very well tested and not active.

- [angular-watch-resource](https://github.com/marmorkuchen-net/angular-watch-resource) - Really only handles collections

- [angular-restful](http://esdrasedu.github.io/angular-restful/#/) - Very basic but nice

- [ngResource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource)
Out of the box model layer, very limited.

- [angularjs-rails-resource](https://github.com/FineLinePrototyping/angularjs-rails-resource)
Too rails-ish.

- [angular-nested-resource](https://github.com/roypeled/angular-nested-resource) - Okay API, not loving the nested architecture.

- [Aar.js](http://aarjs.com/)
Very light, not sure what value this adds.

- [Angular Activerecord](https://github.com/bfanger/angular-activerecord)
A copy of BackboneModel but doesn't really work with Angular patterns.

- [Angular-Data](http://angular-data.pseudobry.com/)
Not really a model layer but a data store.  Very very heavy ( 67kb min )

- [ngActiveResource](https://github.com/FacultyCreative/ngActiveResource)
Very ruby-ish api.  Requires lodash.  Has validation but thats not needed in angular if you do it right.

- [restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular) 
I don't consider this a model layer; it feels moore like a fancy http layer that returns promises because everyone complains about ngResource not doing it.  It requires underscore.

- [BreezeJS](http://www.breezejs.com/) 
This is a very full featured model/cache/validation etc.  Its framework agnostic, which means it follows its own patterns and not angulars.  Its very heavy, requires server data massaging, and the API looks like Microsoft Entity Framework.

- [ng-backbone](https://github.com/adrianlee44/ng-backbone)
Another backbone model clone.  This one actually requires backbone and lodash.

## Install

Install via bower:

```
$ bower install angular-model-factory --save
```

Install via npm:

```
$ npm install angular-model-factory --save
```

Alternatively you can download/clone the repo and link the files in `dist/`. 

### Dependencies

- Angular >= 1.3
