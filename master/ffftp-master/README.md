I haven't worked ont this for a while. I may get back into it, but maybe not. Feel free to check out the forks. **It does still work, though.**

## Building & running it locally:
- Clone the repo.
- cd to the directory
- make sure electron is installed `npm install electron`
- install and run with `npm install && npm start`

## Packaging it (.app for mac, .exe for windows, or for linux)
- Install [Electron Packager Interactive](https://github.com/Urucas/electron-packager-interactive) with `npm install -g electron-packager-interactive`
- run `epi`
- Follow steps
  - Icon is `./icon.ico'
