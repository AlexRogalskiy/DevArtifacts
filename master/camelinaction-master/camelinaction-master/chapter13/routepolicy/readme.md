Chapter 13 - Using RoutePolicy
========================================

This is a example using RoutePolicy to demonstrate how to flip between two routes,
so only one route is active at any time.

To try this example using Java DSL, execute the following command:

    mvn test -Dtest=FlipRoutePolicyJavaDSLTest

To try this example using Spring DSL, execute the following command:

    mvn test -Dtest=FlipRoutePolicySpringXMLTest
