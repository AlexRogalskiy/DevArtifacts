Chapter 13 - Running Camel as Web Application in JBoss 5.x
========================================

This example shows how to run Camel as a Web Application (war) in JBoss 5.x.

Notice that since this book was written, the need for the special camel-jboss module is no longer needed.
See more details at: http://camel.apache.org/camel-jboss.html

You can package this example as a war file using

    mvn install

And the .war file is generated in the target directory.
You can then deploy this WAR file in JBoss AS 5.x.
