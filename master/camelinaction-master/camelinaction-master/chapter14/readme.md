Chapter 14 - Bean routing and remoting
========================

Chapter 14 covers what we consider extra features of Camel: routing with beans and using remoting to hide Camel APIs. We consider this extra because these features do routing without using any of Camelâ€™s DSLs and in some cases with no Camel APIs. They take a different approach than what was discussed throughout the book.
