Chapter 12 -  Using Tracer
========================================

This example shows how to use the Camel Tracer functionality, to trace how messages are routed in Camel in real time.

You can try this example using the following command:

    mvn compile exec:java -PManageTracer

You can then connect to this JVM using jconsole, which allows you to manage the Camel tracer at runtime, where
you can turn on|off options.
