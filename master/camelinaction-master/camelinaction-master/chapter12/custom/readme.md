Chapter 12 -  Managing custom components
========================================

This example shows how you can write a custom Camel component, that
has custom JMX attributes and operations, which you can make available in JMX.

You can try this example using the following command:

    mvn compile exec:java -Pcustom

And then you can connect to the running JVM using jconsole.
