# Sample Rest Server

This Java project contains a basic rest server example (based on the Spark micro framework: http://sparkjava.com/) that I am using to run some CI/CD testing with Jenkins (http://jenkins-ci.com) and CloudBees Enterprise Jenkins (https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-enterprise).

**Note**: There is nothing to see here. Move along.
