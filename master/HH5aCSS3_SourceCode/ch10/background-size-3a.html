        <h1>AJ</h1>
        <p>A.J. is the creative guy for the company. He&rsquo;s uncomfortably crammed
        in that tiny crevasse between the techies and the marketing people. This
        means he&rsquo;s not disliked by anyone, but they all look at him funny from
        time to time. He loves most computer games, nifty art, and has a big
        brother relationship with the Dust Puppy.</p>
