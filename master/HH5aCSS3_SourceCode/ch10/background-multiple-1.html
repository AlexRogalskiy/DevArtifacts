        <p>In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the
        succession of the processes is possible, and various considerations must
        influence the selections amongst them for the purposes of a calculating
        engine. One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall
        tend to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the
        calculation.</p>
        <p>Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies imagine
        that because the business of [Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine] is to give
        its results in numerical notation, the nature of its processes must
        consequently be arithmetical and numerical, rather than algebraical and
        analytical. This is an error. The engine can arrange and combine its
        numerical quantities exactly as if they were letters or any other
        general symbols; and in fact it might bring out its results in
        algebraical notation, were provisions made accordingly.</p>
