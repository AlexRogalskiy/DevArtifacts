    <h1>A quote from Ada Lovelace</h1><p>The Analytical Engine has no
    pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we
    know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis, but it has
    no power of anticipating any analytical revelations or truths. Its
    province is to assist us in making available what we are already
    acquainted with.</p><p>The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic
    patterns, just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.</p>
