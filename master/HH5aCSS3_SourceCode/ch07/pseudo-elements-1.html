  <p>I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because, understand
  it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal fraction of
  all I want to understand about the many connections and relations which occur
  to me, how the matter in question was first thought of or arrived at, etc.,
  etc.</p>
  <p>In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the
  succession of the processes is possible, and various considerations must
  influence the selections amongst them for the purposes of a calculating
  engine. One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall tend to
  reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the calculation.</p>
  <p>Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies imagine that
  because the business of [Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine] is to give its results
  in numerical notation, the nature of its processes must consequently be
  arithmetical and numerical, rather than algebraical and analytical. This is an
  error. The engine can arrange and combine its numerical quantities exactly as
  if they were letters or any other general symbols; and in fact it might bring
  out its results in algebraical notation, were provisions made accordingly.</p>
  <p>The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It
  can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis,
  but it has no power of anticipating any analytical revelations or truths. Its
  province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted
  with.</p>
