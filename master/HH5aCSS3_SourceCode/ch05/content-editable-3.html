        <h1>Stef</h1>
        <p>Stef works as the Corporate Sales Manager. He runs
        most of the marketing efforts within the firm and sells things before
        they exist. He can&rsquo;t understand the way techies think, so
        doesn&rsquo;t get very far with them. He sucks at Quake. Although he
        admires the power of Microsoft&rsquo;s marketing muscle, he has a real
        problem with Microsoft salesmen, probably because they make much more
        money than he does.</p>

        <h1>The Chief</h1>
        <p>The Chief is Columbia Internet&rsquo;s CEO. He is
        the fearless leader for the techies and salespeople, as well as the only
        calm, clear-thinking head in the company. He wouldn&rsquo;t be if he
        knew what was really going on. The Chief is also a closet guitar player,
        having spent years mastering the art of perfect tone, only to have
        computers come along and render all of his effort meaningless.</p>

        <h1 spellcheck="true">Miranda</h1>
        <p contenteditable="inherit" spellcheck="true">Miranda is a trained
        systems technologist, an experienced UNIX sysadmin, and very, very
        female. Her technical abilities unnerve the other techs, but her obvious
        physical charms compel them to stare at her, except for Pitr, who is
        convinced she is evil. Although she has yet to reveal any character
        flaws, it is a commonly held belief in psychological circles that
        "perfect" people like her are deeply disturbed neurotics with
        sociopathic tendencies. Maybe that&rsquo;s why she smiles so much.</p>
