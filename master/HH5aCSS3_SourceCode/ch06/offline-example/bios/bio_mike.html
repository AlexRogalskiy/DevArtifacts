    <h1>Mike</h1>
    <p>Mike works as a System Administrator, and is responsible for the smooth
    running of the network at the office. He's bright but prone to fits of
    anxiety. His worst nightmare is being locked in a room with a sweaty Windows
    95 programmer, and no hacking weapons in sight. He loves hot curries,
    preferably ones with the same properties as Alien acid-for-blood.</p>
