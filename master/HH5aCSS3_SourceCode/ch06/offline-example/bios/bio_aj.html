    <h1>AJ</h1>
    <p>A.J. is the creative guy for the company. He's uncomfortably crammed in
    that tiny crevasse between the techies and the marketing people. This means
    he's not disliked by anyone, but they all look at him funny from time to
    time. He loves most computer games, nifty art, and has a big brother
    relationship with the Dust Puppy.</p>
