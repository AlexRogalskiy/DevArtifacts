    <h1>Greg</h1>
    <p>Greg is in charge of Technical Support at the company. In other words,
    he's the guy that customers turd all over when something goes wrong. He
    blows off steam by playing visceral games and doing Bad Things to the
    salespeople. He's not a bad sort, but his grip on his sanity hovers
    somewhere between weak and non-existent.</p>
