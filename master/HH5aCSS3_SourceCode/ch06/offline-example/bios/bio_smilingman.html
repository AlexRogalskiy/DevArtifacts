    <h1>The Smiling Man</h1>
    <p>The Smiling Man is the company Controller. He is in charge of accounts,
    finances and expenditures. He smiles all day, for no reason. This in itself
    is enough to encourage the other staff to keep pointy objects out of his
    reach. His favourite wallpaper is a large, complex, and utterly meaningless
    spreadsheet</p>
