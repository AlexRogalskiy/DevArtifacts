    <h1>Miranda</h1>
    <p>Miranda is a trained systems technologist, an experienced UNIX sysadmin,
    and very, very female. Her technical abilities unnerve the other techs, but
    her obvious physical charms compel them to stare at her, except for Pitr,
    who is convinced she is evil. Although she has yet to reveal any character
    flaws, it is a commonly held belief in psychological circles that "perfect"
    people like her are deeply disturbed neurotics with sociopathic tendencies.
    Maybe that&rsquo;s why she smiles so much.</p>
