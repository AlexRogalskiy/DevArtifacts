    <h1>Sid</h1>
    <p>Sid is a self-described "lichen of the tech-forest floor," a long-lived,
    deeply experienced and acerbic observer of the geek gestalt. His history in
    computing involved vacuum tubes and later, punch cards. He carries with him
    an air of compassion mixed with disdain for the younger geeks around him,
    mostly because "older geeks know best." He wears a suit and tie, which are
    more often than not rumpled and hairy, since he can't see the need to change
    out of them until he notices things sticking to them.</p>
