    <h1>Pitr</h1>
    <p>Pitr works alongside Mike as a System Administrator. For some reason he
    always wears dark glasses, and has adopted a gutteral Eastern European
    accent. When a server needs to be rebooted, he's very fond of saying "Push
    the button." Pitr is the true iconoclast of the bunch, constantly
    experimenting with strong coffees and strange moulds.</p>
