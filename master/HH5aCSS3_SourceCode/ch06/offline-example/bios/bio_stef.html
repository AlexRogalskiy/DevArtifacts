    <h1>Stef</h1>
    <p>Stef works as the Corporate Sales Manager. He runs most of the marketing
    efforts within the firm and sells things before they exist. He can&rsquo;t
    understand the way techies think, so doesn&rsquo;t get very far with them. He
    sucks at Quake. Although he admires the power of Microsoft&rsquo;s marketing
    muscle, he has a real problem with Microsoft salesmen, probably because they
    make much more money than he does.</p>
