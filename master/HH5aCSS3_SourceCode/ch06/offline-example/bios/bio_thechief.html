    <h1>The Chief</h1>
    <p>The Chief is Columbia Internet&rsquo;s CEO. He is the fearless leader for the
    techies and salespeople, as well as the only calm, clear-thinking head in
    the company. He wouldn&rsquo;t be if he knew what was really going on. The Chief
    is also a closet guitar player, having spent years mastering the art of
    perfect tone, only to have computers come along and render all of his effort
    meaningless.</p>
