    <h1>Dust Puppy</h1>
    <p>The Dust Puppy was born inside of a network server, a result of the
    combination of dust, lint, and quantum events. He is very innocent, with no
    real grasp of reality, but he's pretty cute and people love him, except for
    Stef, who thinks the Dust Puppy is just really weird. Although the Dust
    Puppy isn't very worldly, he plays a great game of Quake. No one knows where
    he got the feet.</p>
