            <p>In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for
            the succession of the processes is possible, and various
            considerations must influence the selections amongst them for the
            purposes of a calculating engine. One essential object is to choose
            that arrangement which shall tend to reduce to a minimum the time
            necessary for completing the calculation.</p>
            <p>Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies
            imagine that because the business of [Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine]
            is to give its results in numerical notation, the nature of its
            processes must consequently be arithmetical and numerical, rather
            than algebraical and analytical. This is an error. The engine can
            arrange and combine its numerical quantities exactly as if they were
            letters or any other general symbols; and in fact it might bring out
            its results in algebraical notation, were provisions made
            accordingly.</p>
