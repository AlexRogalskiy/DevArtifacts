    <p>I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because,
    understand it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal
    fraction of all I want to understand about the many
    connections and relations which occur to me, how the matter in question was
    first thought of or arrived at, etc., etc.</p>
    <p>In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the
    succession of the processes is possible, and various considerations must
    influence the selections amongst them for the purposes of a calculating
    engine. One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall tend
    to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the
    calculation.</p>
    <p>Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies imagine that
    because the business of [Babbage&rsquo;s Analytical Engine] is to give its results
    in numerical notation, the nature of its processes must consequently be
    arithmetical and numerical, rather than algebraical and analytical. This is an
    error. The engine can arrange and combine its numerical quantities exactly as
    if they were letters or any other general symbols; and in fact it might bring
    out its results in algebraical notation, were provisions made accordingly.</p>
    <p>The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It
    can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis,
    but it has no power of anticipating any analytical revelations or truths. Its
    province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted
    with.</p>
