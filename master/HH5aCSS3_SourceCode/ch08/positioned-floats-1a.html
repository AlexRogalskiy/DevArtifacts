    <p>I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because,
    understand it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal
    fraction of all I want to understand about the many connections and
    relations which occur to me, how the matter in question was first thought of
    or arrived at, etc., etc.</p>
    <p>In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the
    succession of the processes is possible, and various considerations must
    influence the selections amongst them for the purposes of a calculating
    engine. One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall tend
    to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the
    calculation.</p>
    <p>Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies imagine
    that because the business of [Babbage&rsquo;s Analytical Engine] is to give its
    results in numerical notation, the nature of its processes must consequently
    be arithmetical and numerical, rather than algebraical and analytical. This
    is an error. The engine can arrange and combine its numerical quantities
    exactly as if they were letters or any other general symbols; and in fact it
    might bring out its results in algebraical notation, were provisions made
    accordingly.</p>
    <p>The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything.
    It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow
    analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any analytical revelations or
    truths. Its province is to assist us in making available what we are already
    acquainted with.</p>
    <p>The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns, just as the Jacquard
    loom weaves flowers and leaves.</p>
