        <p>In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the
        succession of the processes is possible, and various considerations must
        influence the selections amongst them for the purposes of a calculating
        engine.</p>

        <p>I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because,
        understand it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an
        infinitesimal fraction of all I want to understand about the many
        connections and relations which occur to me, how the matter in
        question was first thought of or arrived at, etc., etc.</p>
