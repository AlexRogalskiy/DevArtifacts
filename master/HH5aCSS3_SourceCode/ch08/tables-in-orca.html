            <p>I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because, understand
            it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal fraction of
            all I want to understand about the many connections and relations which occur
            to me, how the matter in question was first thought of or arrived at, etc.,
            etc.</p>  
            <p>In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the
            succession of the processes is possible, and various considerations must
            influence the selections amongst them for the purposes of a calculating
            engine. One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall tend to
            reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the calculation.</p>

            <p>Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies imagine that
            because the business of [Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine] is to give its results
            in numerical notation, the nature of its processes must consequently be
            arithmetical and numerical, rather than algebraical and analytical. This is an
            error. The engine can arrange and combine its numerical quantities exactly as
            if they were letters or any other general symbols; and in fact it might bring
            out its results in algebraical notation, were provisions made accordingly.</p>
            <p>The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It
            can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis,
            but it has no power of anticipating any analytical revelations or truths. Its
            province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted
            with.</p>
