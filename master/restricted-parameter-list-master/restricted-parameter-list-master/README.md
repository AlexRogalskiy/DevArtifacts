A set of two Jenkins parameter plugins which have their value restricted to a set of allowed values to be picked from a list provided by an external program. The restricted string parameter allows for setting a single parameter value. The restricted string dynamic parameter allows for setting two build parameters. For both, the external program will have access to information about the current logged in user. For the dynamic parameter, the command will also have access to the current value selected for the first parameter.
