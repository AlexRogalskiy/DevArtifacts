A restricted string dynamic parameter allows you to specify two variable 
names and two commands that Jenkins will run to generate a list of values
a user can select for the parameter. The environmental variable JENKINS_RSP_USER 
will be set to the username of the user requesting the build on execution 
of both scripts. The environmental variable JENKINS_RSP_VALUE will be set
to the value selected from the first list when executing the command to generate
values for the second list.
