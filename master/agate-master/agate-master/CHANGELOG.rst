* Blank column names are not treated as unspecified (letter names will be generated).

1.5.3 - December 26, 2016
-------------------------

This is a minor release that adds one feature: sequential joins (by row number). It also fixes several small bugs blocking a downstream release of csvkit.

* Fixed empty :class:`.Table` column names would be intialized as list instead of tuple.
* :meth:`.Table.join` can now join by row numbersâ€”a sequential join.

1.5.2 - December 24, 2016
-------------------------

* Improved handling of non-ascii encoded CSV files under Python 2.

1.5.1 - December 23, 2016
-------------------------

This is a minor release fixing several small bugs that were blocking a downstream release of csvkit.

* Documented differing behavior of :class:`.MaxLength` under Python 2. (#649)
* agate is now tested against Python 3.6. (#650)
* Fix bug when :class:`.MaxLength` was called on an all-null column.

* Fix bug in :class:`.Change` and :class:`.PercentChange` where ``0`` values could cause ``None`` to be returned incorrectly.

1.5.0 - November 16, 2016
-------------------------

This release adds SVG charting via the `leather <http://leather.rtfd.io>`_ charting library. Charts methods have been added for both :class:`.Table` and :class:`.TableSet`. (The latter create lattice plots.) See the revised tutorial and new cookbook entries for examples. Leather is still an early library. Please `report any bugs <https://github.com/wireservice/agate/issues>`_.

Also in this release are a :class:`.Slugify` computation and a variety of small fixes and improvements.

The complete list of changes is as follows:

* Remove support for monkey-patching of extensions. (#594)
* :class:`.TableSet` methods which proxy :class:`.Table` methods now appear in the API docs. (#640)
* :class:`.Any` and :class:`.All` aggregations no longer behave differently for boolean data. (#636)

* :class:`.PercentChange` is now null-safe, returns None for null values. (#623)
* :class:`.Table` can now be iterated, yielding :class:`Row` instances. (Previously it was necessarily to iterate :code:`table.rows`.)

1.4.0 - May 26, 2016
--------------------

This release adds several new features, fixes numerous small bug-fixes, and improves performance for common use cases. There are some minor breaking changes, but few user are likely to encounter them. The most important changes in this release are:

1. There is now a :meth:`.TableSet.having` method, which behaves similarly to SQL's ``HAVING`` keyword.

2. :meth:`.Table.from_csv` is much faster. In particular, the type inference routines for parsing numbers have been optimized.

3. The :meth:`.Table.compute` method now accepts a ``replace`` keyword which allows new columns to replace existing columns "in place."" (As with all agate operations, a new table is still created.)

4. There is now a :class:`.Slug` computation which can be used to compute a column of slugs. The :meth:`.Table.rename` method has also added new options for slugifying column and row names.

The complete list of changes is as follows:

* Added a deprecation warning for ``patch`` methods. New extensions should not use it. (#594)
* Added :class:`.Slug` computation (#466)
* Added ``slug_columns`` and ``slug_rows`` arguments to :meth:`Table.rename`. (#466)
* Added :meth:`utils.slugify` to standardize a sequence of strings. (#466)

* :meth:`.Table.print_table` now restricts header on max_column_width. (#605)
* Cookbook: filling gaps in a dataset with Table.homogenize. (#538)
* Reduced memory usage and improved performance of :meth:`.Table.from_csv`.
* :meth:`.Table.from_csv` no longer accepts a sequence of row ids for :code:`skip_lines`.

* Fixed bug in :meth:`.Table.bins` where ``start`` or ``end`` arguments were ignored when specified alone. (#599)
* :meth:`.Table.compute` now accepts a :code:`replace` argument that allows columns to be overwritten. (#597)
* :meth:`.Table.from_fixed` now creates an agate table from a fixed-width file. (#358)
* :mod:`.fixed` now implements a general-purpose fixed-width file reader. (#358)

* Arguments to :meth:`.Table.print_html` now mirror :meth:`.Table.print_table`.

1.3.1 - March 30, 2016
----------------------

The major feature of this release is new API documentation. Several minor features and bug fixes are also included. There are no major breaking changes in this release.

Internally, the agate codebase has been reorganized to be more modular, but this should be invisible to most users.

1.3.0 - February 28, 2016
-------------------------

This version implements several new features and includes two major breaking changes.

Please take note of the following breaking changes:

1. There is no longer a :code:`Length` aggregation. The more obvious :class:`.Count` is now used instead.

2. Agate's replacements for Python's CSV reader and writer have been moved to the :code:`agate.csv` namespace. To use as a drop-in replacement: :code:`from agate import csv`.

The major new features in this release are primarly related to transforming (reshaping) tables. They are:

1. :meth:`.Table.normalize` for converting columns to rows.
2. :meth:`.Table.denormalize` for converting rows to columns.
3. :meth:`.Table.pivot` for generating "crosstabs".
4. :meth:`.Table.homogenize` for filling gaps in data series.

1.2.0 - January 18, 2016
------------------------

This version introduces one breaking change, which is only relevant if you are using custom :class:`.Computation` subclasses.

1. :class:`.Computation` has been modified so that :meth:`.Computation.run` takes a :class:`.Table` instance as its argument, rather than a single row. It must return a sequence of values to use for a new column. In addition, the :meth:`.Computation._prepare` method has been renamed to :meth:`.Computation.validate` to more accurately describe it's function. These changes were made to facilitate computing moving averages, streaks and other values that require data for the full column.

* Existing :class:`.Aggregation` subclasses have been updated to use :meth:`.Aggregate.validate`. (This brings a noticeable performance boost.)
* :class:`.Aggregation` now has a :meth:`.Aggregation.validate` method that functions identically to :meth:`.Computation.validate`. (#421)
* :meth:`.Change.validate` now correctly raises :class:`.DataTypeError`.
* Added a ``SimpleMovingAverage`` implementation to the cookbook's examples of custom :class:`.Computation` classes.
* :meth:`.Computation._prepare` has been renamed to :meth:`.Computation.validate`.
* :meth:`.Computation.run` now takes a :class:`.Table` instance as an argument. (#415)
* Fix a bug in Python 2 where printing a table could raise ``decimal.InvalidOperation``. (#412)
* Fix :class:`.Rank` so it returns Decimal. (#411)
* Added Taurus Olson to AUTHORS.
* Printing a table will now print the table's structure.
* :meth:`.Table.print_structure` implemented. (#393)
* Added Geoffrey Hing to AUTHORS.
* :meth:`.Table.print_html` implemented. (#408)
* Instances of :class:`.Date` and :class:`.DateTime` can now be pickled. (#362)
* :class:`.AgateTestCase` is available as ``agate.testcase.AgateTestCase`` for extensions to use. (#384)
* :meth:`.Table.exclude` implemented. Opposite of :meth:`.Table.select`. (#388)
* :meth:`.Table.merge` now accepts a ``row_names`` argument. (#403)
* :class:`.Formula` now automatically casts computed values to specified data type unless ``cast`` is set to ``False``. (#398)
* Added Neil Bedi to AUTHORS.
* :meth:`.Table.rename` is implemented. (#389)
* :meth:`.TableSet.to_json` is implemented. (#374)
* :meth:`.Table.to_csv` and :meth:`.Table.to_json` will now create the target directory if it does not exist. (#392)
* :class:`.Boolean` will now correctly cast numerical ``0`` and ``1``. (#386)
* :meth:`.Table.merge` now consistently maps column names to rows. (#402)

1.1.0 - November 4, 2015
------------------------

This version of agate introduces three major changes.

1. :class:`.Table`, :meth:`.Table.from_csv` and :meth:`.TableSet.from_csv` now all take ``column_names`` and ``column_types`` as separate arguments instead of as a sequence of tuples. This was done to enable more flexible type inference and to streamline the API.
2. The interfaces for :meth:`.TableSet.aggregate` and :meth:`.Table.compute` have been changed. In both cases the new column name now comes first. Aggregations have also been modified so that the input column name is an argument to the aggregation class, rather than a third element in the tuple.
3. This version drops support for Python 2.6. Testing and bug-fixing for this version was taking substantial time with no evidence that anyone was actually using it. Also, multiple dependencies claim to not support 2.6, even though agate's tests were passing.

* DataType's now have :meth:`.DataType.csvify` and :meth:`.DataType.jsonify` methods for serializing native values.
* Added a dependency on `isodate <https://github.com/gweis/isodate>`_ for handling ISO8601 formatted dates. (#233)

* :class:`.Aggregation` subclasses now take column names as their first argument. (#378)
* :meth:`.TableSet.aggregate` and :meth:`.Table.compute` now take the new column name as the first argument. (#378)
* Remove support for Python 2.6.
* :meth:`.Table.to_json` is implemented. (#345)
* :meth:`.Table.from_json` is implemented. (#344, #347)

* :class:`.Number` data type now takes a ``float_precision`` argument.
* :class:`.Number` data types now work with native float values. (#370)
* :class:`.TypeTester` can now validate Python native types (not just strings). (#367)
* :class:`.TypeTester` can now be used with the :class:`.Table` constructor, not just :meth:`.Table.from_csv`. (#350)
* :class:`.Table`, :meth:`.Table.from_csv` and :meth:`.TableSet.from_csv` now take ``column_names`` and ``column_types`` as separate parameters. (#350)
* :const:`.DEFAULT_NULL_VALUES` (the list of strings that mean null) is now importable from ``agate``.
* :meth:`.Table.from_csv` and :meth:`.Table.to_csv` are now unicode-safe without separately importing csvkit.
* ``agate`` can now be used as a drop-in replacement for Python's ``csv`` module.
* Migrated `csvkit <http://csvkit.readthedocs.org>`_'s unicode CSV reading/writing support into agate. (#354)
