# Uploading Directly to Amazon S3 {: .page-header }

### General Uploads to S3
Please see [the blog post on Fine Uploader S3][s3blog].


### Uploading to S3 Through a CDN
Support for uploads to an S3 bucket via a CDN was added in Fine Uploader 5.1.0. You can upload files to
any S3 bucket through any CDN, provided the CDN forwards all headers and does not append any additional
headers to the request that is sent on to S3. An example of a CDN that should work fine is [fastly][fastly].

#### S3 Transfer Acceleration
Amazon's [S3 Transfer Acceleration option][s3transferacceleration] is by far the easiest way to have your
uploads to S3 go through a CDN (Amazon Cloudfront). To use this feature, simply enable it in your AWS console
and specify `https://[bucket-name].s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com` instead of `https://[bucket-name].s3.amazonaws.com`
for the [`request.endpoint` option][requestendpoint].

#### Custom CDN
When uploading to S3 via a CDN, you must specify the name of the bucket. This is not required when directly
uploading to S3 or when using the Transfer Acceleration option, since Fine Uploader is able to determine the
bucket name by examining the S3 endpoint URL. This is obviously not the case for a CDN endpoint. So, in
addition to specifying the CDN endpoint via the [`request.endpoint` option][requestendpoint], you must also
specify a bucket name via the [`objectProperties.bucket` option][objectpropertiesbucket].

Furthermore, if you are using version 4 signatures, you _also_ must specify the hostname of the S3 bucket via the
[`objectProperties.host` option][objectpropertieshost].

Please see the documentation for these options for more details.

The simplest set up consists of:

```javascript
var uploader = new qq.s3.FineUploader({
    request: {
        endpoint: '{ YOUR_CDN_ENDPOINT_URL }'
        accessKey: '{ YOUR_ACCESS_KEY }'
    },
    objectProperties: {
        bucket: '{ YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME }'
        host: '{ YOUR_S3_BUCKET_HOST_NAME }' // only needed for version 4 signatures
    },
    signature: {
        endpoint: '/s3/signature'
    },
    uploadSuccess: {
        endpoint: '/s3/success'
    },
    iframeSupport: {
        localBlankPagePath: '/success.html'
    }
});
```

### Accounting for browser/client clock drift
If the clock on the machine running Fine Uploader is too far off of the current date, S3 may reject any requests
sent from this machine. To overcome this situation, you can include a [clock drift value][drift-option], in milliseconds, when
creating a new Fine Uploader instance. One way to set this value is to subtract the current time according to the
browser from the current unix time according to your server. For example:

```javascript
var uploader = new s3.FineUploader({
    request: {
        clockDrift: SERVER_UNIX_TIME_IN_MS - Date.now()
    }
})
```

If this value is non-zero, Fine Uploader S3 will use it to pad the `x-amz-date` header and the policy expiration
date sent to S3.


### Headers

If you would like to attach HTTP headers to objects uploaded to your S3 bucket via Fine Uploader S3,
you must specify them as parameters, either via [the `setParams` API method][setparams], or [the `request.params` option][params].
All parameter/header names will be prefixes with "x-amz-meta-", _and_ values will be URI encoded, _except_ for the
following "special" headers:

* Cache-Control
* Content-Disposition
* Content-Encoding
* Content-MD5
* x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id
* x-amz-server-side-encryption
* x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
* x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
* x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

The above header names and values will be untouched. If any of these values needs to be encoded in some way,
you are responsible for doing so _before_ passing the header to Fine Uploader S3.
