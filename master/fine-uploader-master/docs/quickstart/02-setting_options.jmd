# Setting Fine Uploader Options <small>Traditional</small> {: .page-header }

At this point in the tutorial you should have an very simple HTML page with a
Fine Uploader instance. This section will get you started with setting some of
the more common options of Fine Uploader. To see _all_ supported options, open the "API" menu at the top of this page.

{{ alert(
"""If you are using Fine Uploader UI, you MUST include a template in your document/markup.  You can
use the `default.html` file in the `templates` directory bundled with the library and customize it as desired.  See the
[styling documentation page](../features/styling.html) for more details.""") }}

## Basic Options

Fine Uploader comes with a wealth of options. Most importantly, Fine Uploader
requires you to specify the URL where it should send uploads and server
requests to. This endpoint can be an absolute path or a relative path.  The meaning of this
endpoint varies depending on the endpoint handler.  If you are using the traditional uploader,
this is the path endpoint on your server that will handle upload requests.

More information on the [`request` option here](../api/options.html).

```javascript
var uploader = new qq.FineUploader({
    request: {
        endpoint: '/uploads'
    }
});
```

### Debug mode

Debug mode is used to begin diagnosing any application errors. Debug mode can
be enabled in the options of Fine Uploader:

```javascript
var uploader = new qq.FineUploader({
    debug: true,
    request: {
        endpoint: '/uploads'
    }
});
```

With debug mode on, Fine Uploader will spit out log messages to the console.
This allows you to diagnose any application errors and it is recommended to
have this mode on during development.

More information on [debugging errors here](../features/handling-errors.html).

### Retrying Uploads

Networks can be unreliable, and if your upload fails, Fine Uploader offers the
ability to retry. The `retry` option can be set to enable this:

```javascript
var uploader = new qq.FineUploader({
    request: {
        endpoint: '/uploads'
    },
    retry: {
       enableAuto: true // defaults to false
    }
});
```

More information on [retrying uploads here](../features/retry.html).

### Deleting Files

If a user has uploaded a file, but realized it was a mistake before aborting, then FineUploder can also help them delete files.
Fine Uploader supports deleting files via POST, DELETE, and across origins/domains.

A file is eligible for deletion only after it has been successfully uploaded.
In Fine Uploader UI mode, if this feature is enabled, a customizable delete
link will appear next to the file after it has successfully uploaded.  File deletion can be enabled in the Fine Uploader
options.

You can also send a delete request via the `deleteFile` [API method](../api/methods.html).

```javascript
var uploader = new qq.FineUploader({
    request: {
        endpoint: '/uploads'
    },
    deleteFile: {
        enabled: true, // defaults to false
        endpoint: '/my/delete/endpoint'
    }
});
```

More information on [deleting files here](../features/delete.html).

## Putting it together

Now our Fine Uploader page should look something like this:

{{ alert(
"""There are many ways to load Fine Uploader into your project. The code below creates a global `qq` variable, but there are
other, better options. Please see [modules feature page](../features/modules.html) for more details.""") }}
