;//************************************************** Idenfification

;// The protocol version, stored in binary coded decimal.
;// This is available from the device in the bcdDevice field
;// of its DEVICE descriptor.
#define RCPOD_PROTOCOL_VERSION  0x0110

;// Device vendor and product IDs.
;// The RCPOD's device class and protocol are both set to 'vendor-specific'.
#define RCPOD_VENDOR_ID   0xE461
#define RCPOD_PRODUCT_ID  0x0002


;//************************************************** Pin Descriptors

;// Pin descriptors are used several places in the protocol,
;// where a pin on any I/O port with any polarity, or its corresponding
;// tristate register, need to be manipulated. Any pin can be set or cleared,
;// or turned into an input or an output with a pin descriptor.

;// A pin descriptor is represented as an 8-bit byte with the port number,
;// polarity, and bit number packed in. Note that zero is a no-op pin
;// descriptor, so a fixed-size block of pin descriptors can be processed
;// without any extra bytes for length.

;//************************************************** Control requests

;//------------------ Peek/poke

;// Write an 8-bit value (wValue) to a 9-bit address in RAM (wIndex)
#define RCPOD_CTRL_POKE		0x01

;// Read an 8-bit value from the given 9-bit RAM address (wIndex), return
;// it in a 1-byte data packet.
#define RCPOD_CTRL_PEEK		0x02

;// Write 4 bytes sequentially after the last byte written with 'poke',
;// stored continuously in the wValue and wIndex fields.
#define RCPOD_CTRL_POKE4        0x03

;// Read 8 bytes starting at the address in wIndex
#define RCPOD_CTRL_PEEK8        0x04

;//------------------ Analog

;// Read all analog inputs at full precision, returns an 8-byte packet
#define RCPOD_CTRL_ANALOG_ALL   0x10

;//------------------ Asynchronous serial

;// Using current USART settings, perform an optional transmit and optional receive
;// using a buffer at the address in wIndex. The number of bytes specified in the
;// low byte of wValue are transmitted, then from the beginning of the same buffer
;// an asynchronous receive is started. It runs in the background until another
;// transmit is started. The receive can be stopped with no other effects by sending
;// a USART_TXRX with both bytes of wValue set to zero.
;// The receive pointer wraps back to the beginning of the buffer after the number
;// of bytes specified in the high byte of wValue has been received.
;// Either byte of wValue can be zero to perform only a transmit or only a receive.
#define RCPOD_CTRL_USART_TXRX   0x20

;// Sets the pin descriptor to use as a USART transmit enable, in wValue.
;// When transmitting, this pin is asserted, then after the transmission is
;// complete it is deasserted. This feature is disabled by setting the pin to
;// zero (a no-op pin descriptor)
#define RCPOD_CTRL_USART_TXE    0x21

;// Returns the number of bytes received so far in the current serial receive.
;// Note that this can be larger than the receive buffer size if the receive
;// buffer has wrapped around. Note also that this value will wrap around once
;// it passes 255.
#define RCPOD_CTRL_USART_RX_PROGRESS 0x22

;//------------------ General purpose I/O

;// Assert up to 4 pin descriptors given in the bytes of wIndex and wValue.
;// Note that this can be used to deassert pin descriptors by toggling
;// their polairty first.
#define RCPOD_CTRL_GPIO_ASSERT  0x40

;// Read the value of the pin descriptor in wIndex
#define RCPOD_CTRL_GPIO_READ    0x41
