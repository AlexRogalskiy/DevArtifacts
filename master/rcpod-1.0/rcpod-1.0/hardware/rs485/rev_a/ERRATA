Errata for the revision A rcpod-485 PCB and schematic
-----------------------------------------------------

1. The row of resistors including R1, R11, R12, R4, R3, and R7
   is spaced too closely, so not all resistors can lay flat
   against the PCB.

2. The silkscreen for the five LEDs indicates a right-angle
   mount, however upon assembly it was decided that a
   non-right-angle mount would be more useful.

3. The failsafe biasing resistors on the RS-485 line are
   reversed, so the RS-485 bus will be in the wrong state
   when idle. The RX light will be on when no network is attached.
   Workaround:
     - Do not install R8 and R9
     - Solder a 1k resistor between the RS-485+ and VDD on the
       back side of the GPIO header
     - Likewise solder a 1k resistor between RS-485- and GND

4. The electrolytic cap's position makes removing the PIC
   inconvenient. It should be moved out of the path of the
   flatbladed screwdriver I generally use to pry out U1

5. The mounting holes should be grounded, to reduce ESD concerns
