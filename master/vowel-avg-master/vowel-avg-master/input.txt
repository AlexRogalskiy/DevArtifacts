But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a
hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two
older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While
Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether.
Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and
by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler.
Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike,
through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the
computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no
future at all if their brother Ender fails.
