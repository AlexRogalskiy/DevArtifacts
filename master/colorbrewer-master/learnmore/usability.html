<img src="images/colorblind.png" alt="color blind icon" style="float:left;margin-right:5px"/><p><strong>Color Blind Friendly:</strong> This icon indicates that a given color scheme will not confuse people with red-green color blindness.  Red-green color blindness affects approximately 8 percent of men and 0.4 percent of women, although its severity varies and so some schemes will have a "?" indicating it may be a problem for some, but not all folks with color vision impairment.</p>

<img src="images/colorprint.png" alt="print icon" style="float:left;margin-right:5px"/><p><strong>Color Printing Friendly:</strong> Suitable for desktop color printing (based on our color printers - your mileage will vary and you should check on your own printer). We checked Matchprint proofs for all of these schemes and they are all printed in a 2003 journal article and the book Designing Better Maps by Cynthia Brewer. CMYK specs are as close to press-ready as is reasonable.</p>

<img src="images/photocopy.png" alt="photocopy icon" style="float:left;margin-right:5px"/><p><strong>Photocopy Friendly:</strong> This indicates that a given color scheme will withstand black and white photocopying.  Diverging schemes can not be photocopied successfully.  Differences in lightness should be preserved with sequential schemes.</p>

<img src="images/laptop.png" alt="LCD icon" style="float:left;margin-right:5px"/><p><strong>Laptop (LCD) Friendly:</strong> This icon indicates that a given color scheme is suitable for viewing on a laptop LCD display.  Small, portable LCD monitors tend to wash-out colors which results in noticeable differences from computer-to-computer.</p>
