<p style="float:right;width:30%;color:#999;"><strong>TIP:</strong> Try turning off the county borders or making them white; notice a big difference? Try changing the background surrounding the map to see how colors are changed by their surroundings.</p>

<p>The appearance and robustness of a color scheme is in part a product of what else goes on the map and the background over which you are trying to show your colors. Small differences in the color of linework or the presence of other map items (like labels) really has a big impact on the appearance of a color scheme, so be sure to try these options here before settling on a final color scheme.</p>
 
<p>Overlay cities and roads for a first look at how well text and symbols can be read with the area colors you select. Though the examples we have chosen are highways and cities, they should give you a good idea of how other linework or typography will function on the map.</p>

<p>We have also provided a grayscale DEM so you can see what happens to your colors when you combine them with other underlying map data: Generally speaking, colors become harder to distinguish and you will need to user fewer classes of data.</p>
