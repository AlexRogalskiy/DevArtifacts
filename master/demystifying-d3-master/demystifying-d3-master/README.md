===============

Code for the NICAR 2014 d3 workshop.

Once you've cloned this repository, you can move through each stage of the workshop using the git commands listed on the [wiki](https://github.com/rflow/demystifying-d3/wiki/Agenda).

When moving between stages, you will have changed files that will prevent you from moving forward. In order to progress to the next stage, you can run the following command to save your changes onto a "stash": `git stash save`

You won't need your changes moving forward, but they will be available for you to append back to your code later if you need to. Alternatively to clear any changes before you check out the next step, use `git reset --hard`.

For the rest of the instructions, see the wiki agenda here:
