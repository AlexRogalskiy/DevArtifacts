Track Android cell phones in real time and store routes for later viewing.

== Description ==

This is the first and only WordPress plugin that allows you to track Android cell phones in real time. You can watch the cell phones being tracked using google maps or OpenStreetView maps and you can store and reload routes easily for later viewing. The plugin is fully responsive and this means that it will display properly on any device such as a cell phone, tablet or desktop computer.

I hope you find this plugin useful, please rate it and leave a review. Thanks!

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and add it to your WordPress plugins directory.
2. Add this shortcode to any page or post: [gps_tracker]
3. Download Gps Tracker from the Google Play Store onto your Android cell phone and add your user name. Change the website url to your website.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.websmithing.wp.gpstracker

That's it! Click on the "Start Tracking" button and then go to your WordPress website and view your location on the map. Please note that it may take a couple of minutes for the first location to appear. If you are having trouble viewing your first location make sure you are outside and that there are not a lot of trees or something else covering your view of the sky. If it's a really cloudy day, it may take a while to get your first location. This is normal behavior for all cell phones since they tend to have a smaller antenna than a dedicated gps device.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see any of my locations on the map. =

There can be many reasons for this but usually it means that you don't have a clear view of the sky. This can be because of trees, tall buildings or even really cloudy weather. Gps cell phones do not work very well inside a building unless you are near a window. Try finding an open space with a clear view of the sky.

= I see three routes near Seattle, what do I do with those? =

They are just a demo to show you how it works. You can safely delete them whenever you want.

= What is the "View All" button? =

This allows you to view all of your routes that you have stored. To view an individual route either select the route from the drop down box or click on one of the markers.

= What is the "Auto Refresh" button? =

Tapping on this will allow you to track your phone in real tine. The map will automatically be updated every minute.

= What is the drop down box below the map? =

That shows all of your routes. For instance, suppose you track your phone on Monday for 3 hours and then Tuesday for 2 hours. You will then see two routes in the drop down box.

= I want to modify this plugin for my own company or personal use, what can I do? =
