The .net version of GpsTracker is now updated to v3 of google maps, jquery and leaflet. The database file is in the sqlserver directory and this needs to be restored to sql server, please read the quick start guide to see how to do that:

If you want to turn on the adsense advertisement in the map, then change line 8 of google.js to enabled:

    var adsense_status = 'enabled';

and add your adsense channel number and publisher id to line 206 and 207:

    user_adsense.channelNumber = "YOUR_CHANNEL_NUMBER";
    user_adsense.publisherID = "YOUR_PUBLISHER_ID";
