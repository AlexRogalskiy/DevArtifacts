# Plexus&Shaders

This is a WebGL tech demo created using ThreeJS + Vertex Shaders and Fragment Shaders. It consists in a music visualizer with some post-processing shaders and a particle system to stress test ThreeJS technology on modern video-cards. It is a Chrome Experiment, and it is best visualized on Google Chrome (it works fine on Firefox though).

The code was written using a nVidia GeForce GTX 980Ti on my test environment, and any browser achieves 60 frames per second even with all the post-processing shaders and the particles system enabled.

GIFs and Screenshots are ugly... If you have a good video-card, check the [Live **Demo** HERE](http://mgz.me/plexus-shaders) =)
