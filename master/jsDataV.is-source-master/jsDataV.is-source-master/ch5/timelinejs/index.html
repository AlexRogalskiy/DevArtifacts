Additionally, Stanley Wells argues that the scenes involving more than four characters, \"betray an uncertainty of technique suggestive of inexperience.\" As such, the play is considered to be one of the first Shakespeare composed upon arriving in London (Roger Warren, following E.A.J. Honigmann, suggests he may have written it prior to his arrival) and, as such, he lacked theatrical experience. This places the date of composition as most likely somewhere between 1589 and 1591, by which time it is known he was working on the Henry VI plays",

However, scholars continue to debate the relationship between the 1594 A Shrew and the 1623 The Shrew. Some theorise that A Shrew is a reported text, meaning The Shrew must have been written prior to 2 May 1594; others, that A Shrew is an early draft, meaning The Shrew must have been completed sometime after 2 May 1594. There are also arguments that A Shrew may have been a source for The Shrew, that they could be two completely unrelated plays based on the same (now lost) source (the \"Ur-Shrew\" theory), or A Shrew could be an adaptation of The Shrew.

    "evidence": "traditionally, the play has been dated quite early (Ros King, for example, dates it 1586-1589), and has often been seen as Shakespeare's first comedy, perhaps his first play. However, stylistic and linguistic analysis (proportion of verse to prose, amount of rhyme, use of colloquialism in verse, and a rare word test) has placed it closer to the composition of Richard II and Romeo and Juliet, both of which were written in 1594 or 1595. More specifically, the limited setting (it is one of only two Shakespeare plays to observe the Classical unities) and the brevity of the play (Shakespeare's shortest at 1777 lines), along with the great abundance of legal terminology, suggests to some critics the probability of it being written especially for the Gray's Inn performance, which would place its composition in the latter half of 1594. If it was written for Gray's Inn, it most likely represents the first play by Shakespeare which was specifically commissioned. In this case, that commission could have come from Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, a member of the Inns of Court, and Shakespeare's patron.",

So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, The Night of Errors.\" As Comedy of Errors is indeed based on Menaechmus, this is almost universally accepted as a reference to an otherwise unrecorded performance of the play, probably by Shakespeare's own company, the newly formed Lord Chamberlain's Men.",

Additionally, the play is mentioned in Meres' Palladis Tamia (registered on 7 September, with a dedication dated 10 October). It is unknown exactly which one of these three constitutes the first official record of the play.",
    "evidence": "Obviously, the play was written by Christmas 1597, but narrowing the date further has proved difficult, with most efforts focusing upon stylistic evidence. Traditionally, it was seen as one of Shakespeare's earliest plays (Charles Gildon wrote in 1710; \"since it is one of the worst of Shakespeare's Plays, nay I think I may say the very worst, I cannot but think it is his first.') For much of the eighteenth century, it tended to be dated 1590, until Malone's newly constructed chronology in 1778, which dated it 1594. In his 1930 chronology, E.K. Chambers found the play to be more sophisticated than Malone had allowed for, and dated it 1595. Today most scholars tend to concur with a date of 1594-1595, and the play is often grouped with the \"lyrical plays'; Richard II, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream, because of its prolific use of rhyming. These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare's career where he was experimenting with rhyming iambic pentameter as an alternative form to standard blank verse; Richard II has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), Romeo and Juliet more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and Love's Labour's and Midsummer Night more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively). All four tend to be dated to 1594/1595. In support of this, Ants Oras' pause test places the play after Richard III, which is usually dated 1592. Furthermore, Taylor finds possible allusions to the Gray's Inn revels of December 1594 (specifically the Muscovite masque in Act 5, Scene 2), and also finds plausible Geoffrey Bullough's argument that the satire of the King of Navarre (loosely based on Henry of Navarre, who was associated with oath breaking after abjuring Protestantism in 1593) favours a date after December 1594, when Henry survived an assassination attempt.",

    "evidence": "There are only two known references to this play. One is in Meres' Palladis Tamia, the other is on a list by Christopher Hunt, dated August 1603, which gives a list of published plays sold by an Exeter bookseller. Up until 1953, only Meres' reference was known, until Hunt's two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of Thomas Gataker's Certaine Sermones. The discovery was handed over to T.W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 as Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Won. The title suggests the play was written as a sequel to Love's Labour's Lost, which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play, hence Love's Labour's Won's position in the Oxford chronology. However, whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare's known plays, a situation similar to Henry VIII, which was originally performed with the title All is True. As Meres refers to The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Comedy of Errors and The Merchant of Venice, prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was The Taming of the Shrew, but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be Love's Labour's Won. Although Much Ado About Nothing, All's Well That Ends Well and Troilus and Cressida have also been cited as possibilities, these plays tend to be dated later than 1598 (much later in the case of Troilus, although the argument is that Love's Labour's Won is an early draft), and as there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost.",

The four plays also include elaborate punning, rhetorical patterning, a general avoidance of colloquialisms and a high volume of metrical regularity. All four of these plays tend to be dated to 1594-1595. Also important in dating the play is Samuel Daniel's The First Four Books of the Civil Wars, which was entered into the Stationers' Register on 11 October 1594, and published in early 1595. Although some scholars have suggested that Daniel used Shakespeare as a source, which would mean the play was written somewhat earlier than 1594, most agree that Shakespeare used Daniel, especially in some of the later scenes, meaning the play could not have been written earlier than 1595.",

However, some scholars argue that the reference could be to a painting, not a play, whilst others argue there is no evidence that \"K. Richard\" necessarily refers to Richard II, suggesting it could refer to Richard III or to another play entirely. There is no complete consensus on this issue, although most scholars do tend to favour the Richard II theory. The earliest definite performance was at the Globe Theatre on 7 February 1601, organised by the Earl of Essex in a performance probably intended to inspire his supporters on the eve of his armed rebellion against Queen Elizabeth.

    "evidence": "Because the versions of Hamlet which appeared in 1603, in 1604 (again in quarto) and in the First Folio of 1623 differ so much from one another, dating the play is exceptionally difficult. There is also the problem of the Ur-Hamlet, a possible source used by Shakespeare, now lost. Others however, feel that Ur-Hamlet (if it ever existed) was most likely an early draft. Hamlet was written sometime between September 1598 (as it was not included in Meres' Palladis Tamia) and July 1602 (when it was registered in the Stationers Register). Furthermore, internal references to Julius Caesar would indicate the play could not have been written any earlier than September 1599. Additionally, in his 1598 copy of an edition of Geoffrey Chaucer's works, Gabriel Harvey has written that Shakespeare's \"Lucrece & his tragedie of Hamlet, prince of Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort'. Harvey also mentions the Earl of Essex as still alive, which would suggest he wrote the note prior to 25 February 1601, when Essex was executed. This would seem to narrow the date of composition to between September 1599 and February 1601; however, not all scholars accept the veracity of Harvey's note. Internal evidence in the play has also been cited, usually as illustrative of a date of composition of 1600 or 1601. As such, many scholars interpret the available evidence as suggestive of a date of initial composition sometime in 1600, with subsequent revisions. This dating, however, is far from universally accepted.",

A further possible source for the play has evoked some disagreement however. Whilst many scholars feel that Shakespeare used the anonymous play The True Chronicle History of King Leir (entered into the Stationers' Register on 8 May 1605), and hence must have been written between May 1605 and December 1606, others argue that the relationship between the two plays has been inverted, and The True Chronicle History of King Leir was actually written to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare's play, which was probably written in 1603 or 1604.

There is no reference to the play whatsoever prior to 1623, and as such, evidence for its date of composition must come from within the play itself. Taylor concludes that Middleton and Shakespeare were jointly responsible for the play and assigns the composition date to 1605 on the basis of previous analyses of colloquialism-in-verse and rare vocabulary.",

    "record": "possibly by Simon Forman, who records seeing the play in April 1611. However, there is considerable debate amongst scholars as to whether Forman's account is genuine",
    "evidence": "Scholars place the date of composition as somewhere between 1603 and 1607, but efforts to narrow that date have proved inconclusive. Several possible topical references to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 have been proposed and debated among scholars, but these references have not been universally accepted. In 1790, Edward Malone dated the play to 1606, and the vast majority of critics agree with this date even while acknowledging that little conclusive evidence exists, though the date seems correct in the context of Shakespeare's other work of the period. One suggested allusion supporting a date in late 1606 is the first witch's dialogue about a sailor's wife: \"'Aroint thee, witch!\" the rump-fed ronyon cries./Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger\" (1.6-7). This has been thought to allude to the Tiger, a ship that returned to England 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. A few lines later the witch speaks of the sailor, \"He shall live a man forbid:/Weary se'nnights nine times nine\" (1.21-2). The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion, which if correct, confirms that the play could not have been written any earlier than July 1606. A. R. Braunmuller, however, in the New Cambridge edition, finds the 1605-6 arguments inconclusive, and argues only for an earliest date of 1603. Further complicating the dating of Macbeth is the fact that the play shows evidence of later revisions by Middleton, particularly in the witch scenes.",

It first appears together with Shakespeare's other plays in the second issue of the Third Folio of 1664. In a contested field, the most widely accepted theory today is that Shakespeare collaborated on the play with another playwright, probably his younger colleague, George Wilkins. There is no complete agreement what the motives or mechanism of this collaboration were. In 1608, Wilkins published a prose narrative of Pericles purporting to be a narrative version of the play and which contains numerous phrases that seem to recall specific lines in the play, suggesting that work on the play preceded his composition of the prose version. Textual analysis of the play has suggested it be placed as in some close relation with All's Well That Ends Well and Coriolanus, which would confirm a date of 1607-1608.",

Shakespeare's treatment of the grain riots is strikingly reminiscent of the Midlands corn riots of 1607. Though Menenius' fable of the belly was used in other contemporary works, the wording of Menenius's speech about the body politic is derived from William Camden's Remaines (1605). Two possible echoes of George Chapman's Iliad (registered 14 November 1608) support a date of 1608-9. A reference to \"the coal of fire upon ice\" (1.1.170) is a possible allusion to the winter of 1607-08, when the frost was so severe that vendors set up booths on the frozen Thames river and pans of coals were placed on the ice so that pedestrians could warm themselves. An allusion to the complaints about Hugh Myddelton's project to bring water to London has also been detected in Martius' warning to the patricians (3.1.98-9). Taylor says that the cumulative internal evidence all points to a composition date of no earlier than spring of 1608, while others favour late 1608 to early 1609. Several allusions in other works establish a terminal date of composition: Ben Jonson's Epicœne, or The silent woman, composed in late 1609, mocks a peculiar phrase in the play, and Phantasma (registered 6 February 1609), written by Robert Armin, a member of the King's Men from 1599 to 1610, contains a close literary parallel.
