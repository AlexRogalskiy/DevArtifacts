Note: at this point we only support Linux although everything compiles as
      is under cygwin. The library is likely to compile and work under
      other OSes though, especially Unices.

To generate csspp from its tarball, you need cmake and a C++ compiler,
then run the following commands:

   mkdir BUILD
   cd BUILD
   cmake ..
   make

The results will be under the "dist" directory. However, that is "installed"
meaning that it won't know how to find shared libraries (works under cygwin
since the DLL appears along the EXE). You may, however, immediately test the
binary "csspp/src/csspp".

The dist directory is otherwise ready to be installed under /usr.
