#Currency converter#
[Currency converter](https://github.com/AurelioDeRosa/Currency-Converter) is a simple application that helps you convert from a currency to another. You can update the exchange rates everytime you want so you'll have always an up-to-date conversion. Once retrieved, the rates are saved so the user can use the application offline. Currently the app supports the following languages: English, Italian, French and Spanish.

This application is written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the support of several frameworks like jQuery, jQuery Mobile and Cordova (also known as PhoneGap).

##Compilation##
[Currency converter](https://github.com/AurelioDeRosa/Currency-Converter) has been developed with the assumption that the compilation will be done using [Adobe PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com/), but with few adjustments you'll be able to compile with every platform specific environment.

##Compatibility##
Being a Cordova based application, it can run on all the platform supported by the framework. To have a complete list of the operating systems supported, take a look at [official documentation page](http://phonegap.com/about/feature).
