Impressionist UI is the world’s biggest user interface elements pack. We have decided to chip in, because we are good at this and have designed a huge pack that contains over 300 elements for webdesign that represent almost anything one can imagine. The elements are so far distributed on 5 pages. You can find here: Edit Boxes, Tabs, Buttons, Notification Windows, Menus, fast solutions for the Menu tabs, Windows, Backgrounds, Graphics, Sliders, Informational blocks and many others. All the elements have been done in Photoshop using Shapes. This means that all the elements can be zoomed in or out without losing quality. They can be used for web design, mobile interfaces or illustrations. It all depends on your imagination.

Shmidt Sergey was the one to design this cool pack containing 200 (x3) icons. You can change and adapt the icons considering your own tastes and resize them from 16x16px to any size you would think of- anyhow they will look cool. Don’t be afraid to use different styles while using these icons for your design.
