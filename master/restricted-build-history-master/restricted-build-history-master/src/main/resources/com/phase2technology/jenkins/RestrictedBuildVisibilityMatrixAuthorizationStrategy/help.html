	This adds a restriction that the only users that can see the information about a particular build are
	<ul>
		<li>Administrators - those with the administer permission</li>
		<li>The user who initiated the build (or initiated the upstream build that initiated the build)</li>
		<li>Anyone if the build was started by an anonymous user</li>
	</ul>
