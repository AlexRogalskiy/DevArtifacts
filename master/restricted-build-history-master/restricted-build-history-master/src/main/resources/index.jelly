  This plugin provides an authorization strategy that prevents users from seeing jobs they did
  not start unless they are admins or the jobs were initiated by the anonymous user. It also
  provides a post build action which will mark jobs which are visible to the current logged in
  user in the build history widget and which should be used on all jobs if the authorization 
  strategy provided by this plugin is used.
