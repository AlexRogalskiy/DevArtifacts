We had up to Firefox 30+ and a few minutes ago I got the notice that Firefox 31 was released.
I found a way to create a hack to separate it from firefox 30 from their release notes:

/* Firefox 4-30 */
_::-moz-math-stretchy, _:-moz-ui-valid, :root .selector { property:value; }

For that matter, here is one I just created for just Firefox 30...

/* Firefox 30 */
@supports (background-blend-mode:difference,normal) {
    _::-moz-math-stretchy, .selector { property:value; } 
}
