Here is a combination of @media query and @supports that I put together. 
I did not create either of them, just the combination. Interesting that @media and @supports can nest in each other.

You may recognize the @supports part of this from the contributions by guillaume-simons on the browserhacks forum.

/* Chrome 28+ (and Opera 14+) */

@media all and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) { @supports (background-attachment:local) {   
      .selector {} 
}}
