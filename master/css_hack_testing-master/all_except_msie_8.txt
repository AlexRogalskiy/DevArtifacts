I still see WinXP in the wild so here goes... 
I made a pair last night that do this:

/* Anything but Internet Explorer 8 (also not 6-) */
_-webkit-full-screen-ancestor:root, .selector { property:value; }

This one is a bit cleaner...

/* Anything but Internet Explorer 8 (also not 6-) */
_:root, .selector { }

The above is based on the :root selector from the CSS3 Standard:

/* Anything but Internet Explorer 8- */
:root .selector { }
