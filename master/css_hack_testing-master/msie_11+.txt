I have found this one for internet explorer 11 and newer:


/* Internet Explorer 11+ */
_:-ms-fullscreen, :root .selector { }


This one has MSIE 7 and msie 11+, so it works if you use the compatibility mode or not:


/* Internet Explorer 7 (& ie compatability mode),11+ */
_:-ms-fullscreen, .selector { }


Both of these work for internet explorer 11 and newer, but also Safari 5-6 so they are not all that useful:


_::-ms-backdrop, body:last-child .selector { }

_::-ms-backdrop, .selector:not([attr*='']) { } 


I came up with this set when I was working on the firefox hacks and msie 10 hacks that are similar.

Also submitted this to the browserhacks forum.
