Jenns, a contributor to browserhacks.com, posted an old excape trick hack on browserhacks that works in everything but versions of MSIE

html[lang='\
en'] {}

I tested it and sent them the results using this as a test:

html[lang='\
en'] { color:green; }

- - -

   windows 8.0, msie 10 - green

   windows 8.0, msie 7 (compatibility mode) - does not show green

   windows xp, msie 8 - does not show green

   windows 7, msie 9 - does not show green

- - -

It is on the browserhacks site now as such (posted by Hugo):

html[lang='\
en'] .selector {}

- - -

Of course my first thought is 'what can i mix it with and see what happens...'

Crossing it with the \9 property hack you can use it to target only MSIE 10 like so:

html[lang='\
en'] .selector { color:#ff0000\9; }
