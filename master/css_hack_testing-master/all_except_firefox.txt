Testing css hacks to do anything but a specific browser, here is one I came up with that I also shared with Hugo and Tim on the browserhacks.com forum

I have tested this on PC and Mac.

Note: this also excludes old versions of msie (8 and below)

------

_::selection, .selector:not([attr*='']) { }â€‹

sample usage:

_::selection, .non_ff_browsers:not([attr*='']) /* anything but firefox and msie 8- */
{ 
	background-color:#F33;
	color:#fff; 
}

<div class="non_ff_browsers">Anything Except Firefox and MSIE 8-</div>
