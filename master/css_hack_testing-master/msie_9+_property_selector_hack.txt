The _::selection hack I created recently I found can be edited and combined with 
the well-known ie8+ property hack to create an simple hack for Internet Explorer 9+.

/* Internet Explorer 9+ */
_::selection, { property:value\9; }

I just posted this to BrowserHacks.com for possible inclusion.

Cheers!

Jeff
