Here is another one that I have been working on for some time.


At this time 6.1 (and 7) of Safari are able to be separated by CSS from Chrome 22+ (tested up to version 28)


I came up with this one that works for Chrome 22+:


/* Safari 6.1-7, Chrome 22+ */


@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-resolution: .001dpcm),
   screen and(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) { 
      .selector { property:value; } 
}



The Safari 6.1-7 hack I worked out already is the key:


/* Safari 6.1-7  */


@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-color-index:0) {
   .selector {(; property:value; );} 
}



There are new ones that also assist in this:


/* Safari 8 */

_::-webkit-full-page-media, _:future, :root .selector { property:value; }



/* Chrome 22-28 */

@media screen and(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) {
    .selector {-chrome-:only(;
        property:value;
    );}
}
