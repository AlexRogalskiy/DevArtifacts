I have found this one for internet explorer 10 and newer:


/* Internet Explorer 10+ */
_:-ms-input-placeholder, :root .selector { }


This one has MSIE 7 and msie 10+, so it works if you use the compatibility mode or not:


/* Internet Explorer 7 (& ie compatability mode),10+ */
_:-ms-input-placeholder, .selector { }


These two are MSIE 10+ but also Safari 6-7, so not all that useful:

_::-ms-ticks-after, body:last-child .selector { }

_::-ms-ticks-after, .selector:not([attr*='']) { } 


I came up with this set when I was working on the firefox hacks that are similar.

Also submitted this to the browserhacks forum.
