Here is another css media query hack test I have been conducting to target Chrome only (separate from Safari)

- here are my results: - -Jeff- -


@media all and(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0)
{
   ::webkit, .selector { color:red; }
}


this one targets only chrome 22-24 (small subset but it works)

I posted this to browserhacks.com in case they would find it interesting
