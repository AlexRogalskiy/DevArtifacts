Finally finished one that works for Safari 6.1 
(update: this works for Safari 6.1-7.0)

@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-color-index:0) 
{ 
   .selector {(;   property:value;   );} 
}


Here is one I created for Safari 7.1-8.0:

_::-webkit-full-page-media, _:future, :root .selector { property:value; }


I sent these hacks to browserhacks, maybe people can make use of them!
