Working with the dual media query hack and combining it with the previous firefox hacks I posted I got this set to work:

These work for Firefox 11+
(again, like the previous posting there are 2 of them, and tested at browsershots.org)

@media all and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) { @media (min-width: 0px) { .selector { } } }

@media all and (-moz-images-in-menus:0) { @media (min-width: 0px) { .selector { } } }

I just posted these to browserhacks.com
