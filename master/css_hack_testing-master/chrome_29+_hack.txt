Here are some css media query hack tests I have been conducting to target Chrome 29+ (separate from Safari)

- here are my results: - -Jeff- -

I sent this to browserhacks.com -- now posted on the site

@media all and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-resolution: .001dpcm)
{
   .selector { color:red; }
}

Notes: Hugo sent me info that at least one newer opera version may be affected

Testing Results: I found that Opera 16+ are detected

Final Results: Works for Chrome 29+ and Opera 16+ (Chrome 31 is the most recent at the time of this testing)
