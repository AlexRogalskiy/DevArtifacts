Here are some css media query @supports, and underscore hacks I have worked on to isolate various versions of Firefox. 
I have submitted most of these to browserhacks.com for review or inclusion.

This one appears to work for any firefox version and no other browser, 
so unlike most other underscore hacks does not also affect MSIE 7 so it is already very clean:

_:-moz-tree-row(hover), .selector { }


Here is the full set of underscore hacks I have found/created for Firefox.
Others styles of Firefox hacks are here too after these.
All of these have been modified to remove MSIE7 overlap.
Some of these also affect Safari 5-6, and are noted. 
If I find better ones, I will likely include them here as well.

Firefox 1+ (any version of Firefox)
_:-moz-any-link, :root .selector { } 

Firefox 1.5+ 
_:-moz-read-write, :root .selector { } 

Firefox 3+	 
_:-moz-loading, :root .selector { } 

Firefox 3.5+ 
_:-moz-handler-blocked, :root .selector { } 

Firefox 3.6+ 
_:-moz-handler-crashed, :root .selector { } 

Firefox 4+	 
_:-moz-ui-valid, :root .selector { } 

Firefox 6+, Safari 5.1-6	 
_::-moz-progress-bar, :root .selector { } 

Firefox 9+	 
_:-moz-full-screen, :root .selector { } 

Firefox 10+	 
_:-moz-full-screen-ancestor, :root .selector { } 

Firefox 19+, Safari 5.1-6
_::-moz-placeholder, :root .selector { } 

Firefox 21+, Safari 5.1-6	 
_::-moz-range-track, :root .selector { }

More detail below:

Here is one I created to target Firefox 21+, Safari 5-6: 
(3 methods that remove MSIE 7 results)


_::-moz-range-track, :root .selector { } 

_::-moz-range-track, body:last-child .selector { } 

_::-moz-range-track, .selector:not([attr*='']) { } 


for Firefox 19+, Safari 5.1-6: 

_::-moz-placeholder, body:last-child .selector { }

_::-moz-placeholder, .selector:not([attr*='']) { }


and another one: (again 2 methods)


for Firefox 6+, Safari 5.1-6: 

_::-moz-progress-bar, body:last-child .selector { }

_::-moz-progress-bar, .selector:not([attr*='']) { }



both of these next ones I created work for firefox 22 and newer: 


@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (display:flex) { .selector { } }

@supports (-moz-appearance:meterchunk) and (display:flex) { .selector { } }



I Submitted these to browserhacks (firefox 8+ hacks are now posted on browserhacks.com)



Firefox 8+ (2 working media query hacks):


@media all and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-resolution: .001dpcm) { .selector { } }

@media all and (-moz-images-in-menus:0) and (min-resolution: .001dpcm) { .selector { } }


Firefox 3-


@media \0 all { body:last-child .selector { } }


notes: 

media \0 all { }

-also works for MSIE 8 without the 'body:last-child' combination

guillaume-simons posted a few css hacks to the forum, I modified them to target just Firefox:

@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (cursor:zoom-in) { .selector { } } - Firefox 24+
@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (background-attachment:local) { .selector { color:red; } } - Firefox 25+
@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (image-orientation:90deg) { .selector { } } - Firefox 26+
@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (all:initial) { .selector { } } - Firefox 27+
@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (list-style-type:japanese-formal) { .selector { } } - Firefox 28+
@media all and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-resolution:3e1dpcm) { .selector { } } - Firefox 29+ [this one already is firefox alone and works well]
@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (background-blend-mode:difference,normal) { .selector { } } - Firefox 30+
