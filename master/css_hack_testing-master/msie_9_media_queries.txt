Here are some css media query hack tests I have been conducting to isolate Internet Explorer 9 and 9+ 

- here are my combined results: - -Jeff- -


For MSIE 9


@media all and (min-width:0\0) and (min-resolution: .001dpcm)
{
   .selector { color:red; }
}


For MSIE 9+ (9-11 -- at this time internet explorer 11 is out for windows 8.1)


@media all and (min-width:0\0) and (min-resolution: +72dpi)
{
   .selector { color:red; }
}


Another one: (not as pretty, works...)


@media all and (min-width:0\0) and (min-resolution: .001dpcm), all and (-ms-high-contrast: active), (-ms-high-contrast: none)
{
   .selector { color:red; }
}
