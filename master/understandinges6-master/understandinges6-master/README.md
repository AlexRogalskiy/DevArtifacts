ECMAScript 6 represents the biggest change to the core of JavaScript in the history of the language. Not only does the sixth edition add new object types, but also new syntax and exciting new capabilities. The result of years of study and debate, ECMAScript 6 reached feature complete status in 2014. While it will take a bit of time before all JavaScript environments support ECMAScript 6, it's still useful to understand what's coming and which features are available already.

This book is a guide for the transition between ECMAScript 5 and 6. It is not specific to any JavaScript environment, so it is equally useful to web developers as it is Node.js developers.

What you'll learn:

* All of the changes to the language since ECMAScript 5
* How the new class syntax relates to more familiar JavaScript concepts
* Why iterators and generators are useful
* How arrow functions differ from regular functions
* Additional options for storing data using sets, maps, and more
* The power of inheriting from native types
* Why people are so excited about promises for asynchronous programming
* How modules will change the way you organize code

### Leanpub Markdown

Leanpub uses a specific flavor of Markdown for its source files. Please be sure to read [their documentation](https://leanpub.com/help/manual#leanpub-auto-styling-text) about what is allowable and what is not.

**Note:** It may be frustrating, but Leanpub does not support GitHub-flavored Markdown.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will the book be finished?

To be determined. Since I'm writing this in my spare time, it's hard to predict when it will be complete. The goal is to have it complete by December 2014, but that is a goal and not a deadline.

### If I buy a copy now, do I get the finished one?

Yes. When you buy a copy today, you will automatically get all updates for the book. You'll be notified of updated versions via email after purchase.

### How often is the book published?

Roughly every week or two the changes in GitHub are published to Leanpub.

### What is the state of content in GitHub?

Everything in GitHub is a work in progress. Those parts that are known to be correct and fully-formed enough to be valuable are published to Leanpub. That's why there's more content in GitHub than is available on Leanpub, as GitHub contains everything, including content that's not quite ready for the book.

### Will there be a print version of the book?

In all likelihood yes. I've already been contacted by a couple of publishers, but there will be no final decision made until the content of the book is complete. This is intentional on my part because publishers have deadlines, and I'm unable to estimate when I'll have the book finished.

### Can I acquire translation rights?

Not at this time. I will likely leave that to the publisher of the print book.
