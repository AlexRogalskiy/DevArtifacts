Thanks for contributing to Panini! If you're adding a new feature, it can be helpful to open a new issue first, so the feature can be discussed before we commit to it.

Before submitting your pull request, make sure all the existing unit tests pass. You can run the tests with the `npm test` command. If you're adding a new feature to Panini, please also add new unit tests for the feature.
