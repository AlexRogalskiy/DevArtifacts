**Note:** if you have a question about how to use Handlebars, we recommend asking it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/handlebars.js). The Panini issue tracker is for reporting bugs (and requesting features) related to using Panini specifically.

If you're encountering an error while using Panini, please paste in the error message, and if possible, the code for the page that isn't working. It's super helpful.

Lastly, thanks for contributing to the project! :)
