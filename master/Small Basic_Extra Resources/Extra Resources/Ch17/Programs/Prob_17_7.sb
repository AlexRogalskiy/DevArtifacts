' a. Zero out all the elements of the 6Ã—6 roll matrix.
For R = 1 To 6
  For C = 1 To 6
    roll[R][C] = 0
  EndFor
EndFor

' b. Start a loop that runs 36,000 times. In each iteration of the loop,
' get two random numbers from 1 to 6 (one for the first die and the
' other for the second die). Then increment the element in roll that corresponds
' to the pair of numbers you obtained. For example, if the first
' die was a 2 and the second die was a 4, increment roll[2][4] by 1.
For I = 1 To 36000
  R = Math.GetRandomNumber(6)
  C = Math.GetRandomNumber(6)  
  roll[R][C] = roll[R][C] + 1
