      "## New York Times corpus\n",
      "The authors of the paper only use a subset of the New York Times corpus and only use articles from 2003-2007 and by filtering out articles and summaries that were very short or very long, as well as several special article types (e.g., corrections and letters to the editor). The full labeled dataset includes 110,639 documents with 2,229,728 labeled entities; about 14% are marked as salient. 9,719 documents from 2007 are used as test data and the rest as training.\n",

The second part of the table describes an approach in which several methods are added to a previous approach. You can see that the score gets higher further down the second part of the table. The table describes the precision ($P$), recall ($R$) and $F_1$ score of each approach.\n",
