				<p>It is well known that Mr. Darwin's theory on the
					<span class="twitter_search">Origin of Species</span> has been
					accepted in <span class="twitter_search">Germany</span> more widely, with more absolute faith, and with more
					vehement enthusiasm, than in the country of its birth. In Germany, more
					conspicuously than elsewhere, it has itself become the subject of
					developments as strange and as aberrant as any which it assumes in the
					history of Organic Life. The most extravagant conclusions have been drawn
					from it - invading every branch of human thought, in <span class="twitter_search">Science</span>, in Philosophy,
					and in <span class="twitter_search">Religion</span>. These conclusions have been preached, too, with a
					dogmatism as angry and as intolerant as any of the old theologies.
					It is
					the fate of every idea which is new and fruitful, that it is ridden to the
					death by excited novices. We can not be surprised if this fate has
					overtaken the idea that all existing animal forms have had their ancestry
					in other forms which exist no longer, and have been derived from these by
					ordinary generation through countless stages of descent. Although this is
					an idea which, whether true or not, is entirely subordinate to the larger
					idea of <span class="twitter_search">creation</span>, it usurps in many minds the character of a substitute.
					This is natural enough.
				</p>
				<p>The theory, or at least the language, of
					<span class="twitter_search">Evolutionists</span>, puts forward a visible order of phenomena as a complete and
					all-sufficient account of its own origin and cause. However unsatisfactory
					this may be to the higher faculties of the mind, it is eminently {6}
					satisfactory to those other faculties which are lower in the scale. It
					dismisses as needless, or it postpones indefinitely, all thought of the
					agencies which are ultimate and unseen. Just as in the physical world, some
					trivial object which is very near us may shut out the whole of a wide
					horizon, so in the intellectual world, some coarse mechanical conception
					may shut out all the kingdom of Nature and the glory of it.

				Two great subjects of investigation lie before us. The first is to
					ascertain how far the <span class="twitter_search">Theory of Evolution</span>
						represents an universal fact, or
					only one very partial and fragmentary aspect of a great variety of facts
					connected with the origin and development of Organic Life. The second and
					by far the most important inquiry, is to estimate aright, or as nearly as
					we can, the relative place and importance of these facts in the Philosophy
					of Nature.
				</p>
				<p>Subjects of investigation so rich and manifold as these may well attract
					all the most varied gifts of the <span class="twitter_search">human mind</span>. This they have already done,
					and there is every indication that they will continue to do so for
					generations yet to be. Already an immense literature is devoted to them;
					and every fresh effort of observation and of reasoning seems to open out
					new and fruitful avenues of thought. The work which is here introduced to
					the English reader contains an excellent review of this literature, so far
					as it is represented in the English and German languages. Knowing the
					author personally, as I have done for many years, I recognize with pleasure
					in his work all the carefulness of inquiry, and all the conscientiousness
					of reasoning, which belong to a singularly candid and patient mind.
