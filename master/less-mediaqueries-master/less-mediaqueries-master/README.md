# Media queries for .LESS

---

### Who had this idea?

I just saw that [Rafal Bromirski](http://paranoida.com) created media queries for SCSS.

So i just wanted to port this for LESS, but with another syntax.

### What is it?

This is just a small collection of different presets for the recognization of mobile devices in .css files.

You can import them into existing projects without the need to modify anything.

This will save your time, trust me.

### Browser support

Only modern browsers that support media queries.

## What's inside?

```
Requirements:
  LESS 1.3.3+

@hdpi-value                  (HDPI pixel ratio)

## How does it work?

Those "Presets" are just pre-written @variables.

Use them in combination with the ```@media``` function provided by LESS.

## How to use?

### 1. Step:
Import ```less-mediaqueries.less```:

```
@import "../less-mediaqueries.less";
```

### 2. Step:
Use the presets just like in the following example:

```
.test-class {
  color: red;

  @media @iphone {
    color: green;
  }

  @media @hdpi {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

This will be output:

```
.test-class {
  color: red;
}

@media only screen and (min-device-width: 320px) and (max-device-width: 480px) and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 1) {
  .test-class {
    color: green;
  }
}

@media only screen and (min-device-width: 320px) and (max-device-width: 568px) and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (device-aspect-ratio: 40/71) {
  .test-class {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

You can also combine the presets to get a wider range of devices:

Input:

```
.multiple-presets {
  @media @hdpi,@mdpi {
    color: hotpink;
  }
}
```

Output:

```
@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:  1.3 ) and (-moz-min-device-pixel-ratio:  1.3 ) and (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio:  1.3 ) and (min-resolution:  125 dpi) and (min-resolution:  1.3 dppx), only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:  1 ) and (-moz-min-device-pixel-ratio:  1 ) and (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio:  1 ) and (min-resolution:  96 dpi) and (min-resolution:  1 dppx), only screen and (device-width: 320px) and (device-height: 480px) {
  .multiple-presets {
    color: hotpink;
  }
}
```

### That's it!
