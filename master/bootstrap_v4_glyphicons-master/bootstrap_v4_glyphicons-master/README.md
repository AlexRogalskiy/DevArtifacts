# Glyphicons for Bootstrap v4.0

I was very mad that they have removed glyphicons in Bootstrap 4.0 so I isolated the code and other files from Bootstrap 3.3.7 so you can now use them with Bootstrap 4.

All you have to do is download the <code>glyphicons.css</code> file and the <code>glyphs</code> folder into your websites directory and then link the <code>glyphicons.css</code> stylesheet like you would any other.

<pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/glyphicons.css" />
</pre>
