(1) WHAT IS THE TCL PLUGIN?

    The XChat Tcl Plugin adds the complete Tcl scripting language to the
    XChat 1.9.x and 2.x IRC client.  The design philosophy behind the tcl
    plugin was to give all the power of the C API. yet completely shield
    the user from all the complexities of it.  It is lightly modeled after
    after Xircon; an old windows TCL enabled client with a little bit of
    eggdrop functionality to it.

    Features:
     * Uses the popular TCL scripting language.
     * Familiar to eggdrop bot owners.
     * Adds many new XChat specific commands to the Tcl language for 
       handling of events, user commands, timers, etc. 
     * It's actually documented! (Hey, what a concept!) 
     * Works with XChat 1.9.x and 2.x. 
     * Open source (GPL) 

    The supplied documentation for Tcl Plugin commands can be 
    found in doc/tclplugin.html
