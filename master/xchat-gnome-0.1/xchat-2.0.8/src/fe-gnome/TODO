pre-release:
  * come up with a tagline (maybe "it's called ex-chat for a reason" ??)

----

autotools:
  * check for an adequate version of gnome-icon-theme, etc
  * autogenerate inline pngs during build


* make strings translateable --> _("blah")
* if a word-check function is installed into xtext, should make URLs blue
* add/remove in the server list
* the way it looks up the icon is *really* expensive, and this happens every
  time a row is updated. Should probably move the icon theme initialization
  to be "global" and only look up the icon on a new add (icon in transfers
  window)
* split the transfers window into separate send & recieve windows
* split other dialogs out of xchat-gnome.glade (difficult at this point)
* make things static where possible
* hook up pgup/pgdn
* hook up ctrl+u, ctrl+e, ctrl+a, etc
* topic bar should have a tooltip with the entire topic
* position of panes should be saved
* double clicking on an item in the server config list should open its edit box
* need to be able to add new servers

* sort the server/channel list in non-case alphabetical order

* fix the about dialog such that it uses a real copyright symbol (check galeon's source
  for this)
* make the connect dialog check existing open networks before creating a new connection

* use gnome-config data to store window sizes,etc rather than GConf

* find a writer to rewrite all the horribly-worded explainations of things!

* migrate all menus (main, context, etc) to use GtkUIManager

* Figure out what causes the TreeIters to become invalid after a call to
  navigation_model_*_ref/unref

context menus:
* flesh out the userlist context menu
* make the context menu for navtree stuff actually dependent on context - see above note
  about leave/close stuff
