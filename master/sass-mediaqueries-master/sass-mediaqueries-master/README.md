```
##How does it work?

**Important**: Whenever you use screen mixins (min-screen, screen, ...) there is no need for using units. However, if you want to use units different than 'px' remember about overriding them inside your scss / sass file.

## Example 1
### min-screen(min-width) - [demo](http://paranoida.github.com/sass-mediaqueries/demo)
It's a shortcut for **@media screen and (min-width ... ) { ... }**. Works great with [mobile first](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933) philosophy

```
@include min-screen(320)  { ... }
@include min-screen(480)  { ... }
@include min-screen(768)  { ... }
@include min-screen(1024) { ... }
```
It will be compiled to:

```
@media screen and ( min-width: 320px) )
{
  ...
}
@media screen and ( min-width: 480px )
{
  ...
}
@media screen and ( min-width: 768px )
{
  ...
}
@media screen and ( min-width: 1024px )
{
  ...
}
```

## Example 2
### max-screen(max-width) - [demo](http://paranoida.github.com/sass-mediaqueries/demo)

It's a shortcut for **@media screen and (max-width ... ) { ... }**.

**How to use it properly?** You should start from the widest screen resolution and proceed to the narrowest one (styles are inherited from previous conditions).

```
@include max-screen(1024) { ... }
@include max-screen(768)  { ... }
@include max-screen(640)  { ... }
```
It will be compiled to:

```
@media screen and ( max-width: 1024px )
{
  ...
}

@media screen and ( max-width: 768px )
{
  ...
}

@media screen and ( max-width: 640px )
{
  ...
}
```

## Example 3
### screen(min-width, max-width) - [demo](http://paranoida.github.com/sass-mediaqueries/demo)

You can add style rules for ranges. It could be really helpful if you want to target **group of devices** or just **one** with particular screen resolution.

```
@include screen(768, 1280) { ... }
@include screen(320, 640)  { ... }
```
It will be compiled to:

```
@media screen and ( min-width: 768px ) and ( max-width: 1280px )
{
  ...
}

@media screen and ( min-width: 320px ) and ( max-width: 640px )
{
  ...
}
```

## Example 4
### iOS devices - [demo](http://paranoida.github.com/sass-mediaqueries/demo)

You can easily manage styles for particular iOS devices:

```
@include ipad-retina { ... }              // only iPad with retina
@include ipad { ... }                     // only iPad with retina (1, 2, Mini)

@include iphone5 { ... }                  // only iPhone 5
@include iphone4 { ... }                  // only iPhone 4/4S
@include iphone3 { ... }                  // only iPhone 2/3G/3GS
```

## Example 5
### device orientation - landscape and portrait - [demo](http://paranoida.github.com/sass-mediaqueries/demo)

Want to add extra stuff only in landscape / portrait mode? Piece of cake:

```
@include ipad-retina { ... }              // common part only for iPad (3, 4) - landscape & portrait
@include ipad-retina-landscape { ... }
@include ipad-retina-portrait  { ... }

@include iphone5 { ... }                  // common part only for iPhone 5 - landscape & portrait
@include iphone5-landscape { ... }
@include iphone5-portrait  { ... }

@include iphone4 { ... }                  // common part only for iPhone 4/4S - landscape & portrait
@include iphone4-landscape { ... }
@include iphone4-portrait  { ... }
```

another one:

```
@include ipad-landscape { ... }           // only iPad (1, 2, Mini) - landscape
@include ipad-retina-landscape { ... }    // only iPad (3, 4) - landscape

@include iphone3-landscape { ... }        // only iPhone 2/3G/3GS - landscape
@include iphone4-landscape { ... }        // only iPhone 4/4S - landscape
@include iphone5-landscape { ... }        // only iPhone 5 - landscape
```

## Example 6
### hdpi(ratio) - [demo](http://paranoida.github.com/sass-mediaqueries/demo)

```
.example
{
  ...

  @include hdpi { ... }                   // only devices with hidpi displays (including retina)
}
```

or to narrow down:


```
.example
{
  ...

  @include hdpi(2) { ... }                // only devices with retina
}
```
