Feature detection has always been a good practice, but unfortunately we could only do that kind of thing using JavaScript. But not anymore.

CSS Feature Queries allow authors to condition rules based on whether particular property declarations are supported in CSS using the `@supports` at rule.

For now it's available in FF 22+, Opera 12.1+, and Chrome 28+.
