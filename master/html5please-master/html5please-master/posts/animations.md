Animations are now supported unprefixed in every major browser, but you will need to use the `-webkit-` prefix for older versions.

In order to provide support for legacy browsers, either use animations only to provide non-essential aesthetic enhancements or use feature detection to provide an alternative experience for browsers that do not support this feature.
