ECMAScript version 6 is the upcoming version of JavaScript that brings new features and heavy syntax changes. 

Currently not any browser supports all ES6 features. You can check the [ES6 compatibility table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) for details.

There is the [ES6-shim](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim) project that attempts to shim a subset of ES6 however this subset is quite small, it does not subset any new syntax. If you want to take adventage of the new syntax today, you can consider an ES6 to ES5 compiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler).
