# BBMBot

The BBMBot provides an example of how to write a bot in Node.js which can send messages to, and receive messages from, other BBM Enterprise SDK clients. It uses the botlibre (www.botlibre.com) webservice as an example of how to generate responses.

## Features

With the BBMBot example, your app can do the following:

- Invite the bot to a 1:1 or multi-person chat.
- In a 1:1 chat, write to the bot, and the bot will respond.
- In a multi-person chat, the bot will respond only to messages which begin with "@bbmbot".
