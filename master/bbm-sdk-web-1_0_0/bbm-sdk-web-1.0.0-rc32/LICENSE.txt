BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS, OR BY COPYING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACTIVATING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.   IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT CLICK TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS OR COPY, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACTIVATE OR USE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE.

A.	Definitions:

f.	“Open Source Software” means any software or software component, module or package that contains, or is derived in any manner (in whole or in part) from, any software that is distributed as free software, open source software or similar licensing or distribution models, including, without limitation, software licensed or distributed under any of the following licenses or distribution models, or licenses or distribution models similar to any of the following:  (i) GNU’s General Public License (GPL) or Lesser/Library GPL (LGPL); (ii) the Artistic License (e.g., PERL); (iii) the Mozilla Public License; (iv) the Netscape Public License; (v) the BSD License; and (vi) the Apache License.
g.	“SDK” or “Software” means the BlackBerry BBM Enterprise Software Development Kit and any related documentation and updates thereto.

B.	Limited License Grant:  
Subject to your compliance with the terms of this agreement, BlackBerry grants you the following limited license(s) (“Licenses”):
a.	Development License.  BlackBerry hereby grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, revocable right to use the Software solely for the purpose of developing and testing Applications using Developer Test Data internally within Developer’s organization and not for purposes of any distribution to any third party, commercial or otherwise (“Development Usage”), in accordance with the terms of this agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, any Applications which access or make use of any application program interface that is provided to you in the Software may not be installed or used pursuant to the Licenses granted hereunder, except in an internal test environment for Development Usage and pursuant to Section Bb. (Proof of Concept Trials).
b.	Proof of Concept Trials.  You may authorize up to a sixty (60) day trial for each of your potential Customers to evaluate the Application, provided that you shall ensure that each Customer and the Application is in compliance with this agreement.  BlackBerry will cooperate with you regarding the provisioning process for trial accounts.
c.	Commercial Implementation.  The License under this agreement is for the Development Usage and for limited Customer Proof of Concept Trials only.  Your commercial implementation of the Application with the Software is not covered by this agreement or the Licenses and shall be subject to a separate written agreement to be mutually agreed upon by you and BlackBerry.

C.	Records and Reconciliation:  
You will, during the term of this agreement, and for one (1) year following its termination, create and maintain records regarding your use and distribution of the Software, which records shall include, without limitation, every installation and use of the Software and the distribution of any credentials for the Software (collectively, “Records”).  At BlackBerry’s request, you will promptly provide such Records to BlackBerry for the purpose of BlackBerry verifying compliance with this agreement.  In the event of any inconsistency between BlackBerry’s records regarding your installation or use of the Software and the Records, BlackBerry’s records shall be deemed to be accurate (unless BlackBerry’s records are definitively proven by you to be incorrect).  If you fail to create, maintain or deliver Records as required under this Section C (Records and Reconciliation) or if there is any dispute as to the accuracy of Records, BlackBerry may audit your use of the Software (e.g., via review of copies of applicable server or device log files, etc.), at any location in which it is or has been installed or otherwise used, subject to your reasonable policies with respect to security and confidentiality.

D.	Support:  
For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to this agreement, BlackBerry will not supply, and Customers are not entitled to, any support, warranty or documentation associated with the Software.  BlackBerry may extend, enhance, or otherwise modify the Software provided hereunder at any time without notice, but is under no obligation to do so. If updates are made available to you by BlackBerry, the terms of this agreement will govern such updates, unless the update is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. You acknowledge that BlackBerry has no express or implied obligation to announce or make available any updates to the Software, or to any services, to anyone in the future. Without limiting the above, BlackBerry may (but shall have no obligation to) provide you with web-based maintenance or support regarding, or updates to, the Software.

E.	Open Source Software:  
To the extent any license to any Open Source Software requires that BlackBerry provide Developer the rights to copy, modify, distribute or otherwise use any Open Source Software that are inconsistent with the limited rights granted to Developer in this agreement for Software, then such rights in the applicable Open Source Software license shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this agreement, but solely with respect to such Open Source Software. Developer acknowledges that unless otherwise required by the applicable Open Source Software license, each Open Source Software license is solely between Developer and the applicable licensor of the Open Source Software. Developer shall comply with the terms of all applicable Open Source Software licenses, if any. If your Application includes any Open Source Software, you agree to comply with all applicable Open Source Software licensing terms. You also agree not to use any Open Source Software in the development of your Application in such a way that would cause the non-Open Source Software portions of the software to be subject to any Open Source Software licensing terms or obligations.

F.	Application, Software & Service Restrictions:
a.	Developer shall not (and shall not allow its personnel or any third party to):  (i) modify or create Derivative Works of any Software without the express written consent of BlackBerry; (ii) reverse engineer or attempt to discover any source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of any Software (except to the extent that applicable law prohibits such reverse engineering restrictions), (iii) remove or alter any product identification, trademark, copyright or other notices embedded within or appearing with or on the Software, or (iv) provide, lease, lend, sublicense, use for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use, or allow the use, of any Software for the benefit of any third party (including by way of multiplexing or pooling) other than permitted by BlackBerry in writing. Developer shall be solely responsible to BlackBerry for the observance and compliance with all terms and conditions hereunder by its employees, contractors, service providers and agents (including its affiliates) and any other third party who has been permitted access to the any Software as a result of Developer’s action or inaction. Developer shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend BlackBerry and its licensors from and against any claims or suits, including attorney fees and expenses, which arise or result from any unauthorized or illegal use or distribution of any Software by (or permitted by) the Developer.
b.	Technical & Application Requirements.  Developer acknowledges that BlackBerry reserves the right to accept, limit, or reject your access to the Software and/or services. Without limitation:
i.	Each copy of an Application that incorporates Software shall display the following copyright statement: Portions of this software are © 2017 BlackBerry Limited.  Developer agrees to display any alternative copyright statement required by BlackBerry in writing from time to time.
ii.	You understand that BlackBerry reserves the right to: (1) limit or terminate access to the Software and/or services to Applications which in BlackBerry’s reasonable judgment exceed BlackBerry’s acceptable usage policies in effect from time to time (“AUP”); or (2) charge for Software and/or services for Applications which exceed BlackBerry’s AUP.
iii.	Applications must not contain any malware, malicious or harmful code, program, or other internal component (e.g., computer viruses, trojan horses, “backdoors”) which could damage, destroy, or adversely affect the Software, services, or other software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, services, or networks.
iv.	Without limitation, BlackBerry reserves the right to reject any further commercial agreement related to an Application which: (1) has as its primary functionality the mobile delivery of email/calendar/contacts or other functionality offered by products of BlackBerry; or (2) are, or are primarily marketed to consumers as, a consumer-to-consumer chat or messaging platform.
c.	DEVELOPER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SOFTWARE IS A GENERAL PURPOSE DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM AND AGREES THAT THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICE MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF DATA RELATING TO EMERGENCY, MISSION CRITICAL OR LIFE THREATENING SITUATIONS OR FOR USE REQUIRING FAILSAFE PERFORMANCE AND OR WHERE FAILURE COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.

G.	No Warranty:  
BLACKBERRY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE IS ERROR FREE. THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BLACKBERRY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, DESIGN OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE, OR WARRANTIES CONCERNING THE NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. NO WARRANTY IS PROVIDED AND NO LIABILITY IS ASSUMED BY BLACKBERRY REGARDING DATA PROTECTION OR SECURE PROCESSING OR STORAGE OF ANY DATA.

H.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:  
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY), OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY:  
a.	BLACKBERRY AND ITS SUPPLIERS EXCLUDE AND DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY:  (i) FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, (ii) FOR LOSS OF PROFIT (WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), INCOME, DATA, REVENUE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, COST OF SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, OR OTHER ECONOMIC LOSS; (iii) OF ANY KIND RESULTING FROM MISUSE OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, OR FROM ANY FAILURE BY YOU OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO KEEP SECURE OR LIMIT ACCESS TO SERVERS AND DEVICES; (iv) DURING ANY DEVELOPMENT USAGE, TRIAL, EVALUATION, DEMONSTRATION, BETA OR TESTING PERIOD; AND (v) WITH RESPECT TO SERVERS, DATA ACCESS, OR THIRD PARTY HARDWARE, SOFTWARE OR SERVICES NOT PROVIDED BY BLACKBERRY;
b.	UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BLACKBERRY AND/OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU HEREUNDER TO BLACKBERRY DURING THE SIXTY (60) DAY PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH THE LIABILITY AROSE; 
c.	NO THIRD PARTY CAN ENLARGE BLACKBERRY’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT NOR RESTRICT THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INJURY OR DEATH, OR FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU TO THAT EXTENT.

I.	Indemnification:
a.	Infringement of Third Party Intellectual Property.  BlackBerry shall defend you against any claim brought by a third party against you alleging that the Software provided by BlackBerry to you under this agreement infringes its intellectual property right (“Infringement Claim”), but only if:  
(i) you promptly notify BlackBerry in writing of such Infringement Claim and such notification occurs while this agreement remains in effect; (ii) BlackBerry is given sole authority and control of the defense of such Infringement Claim; and (iii) you supply all requested information and assistance to BlackBerry, at BlackBerry’s reasonable expense, for resolution or defense of the Infringement Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any third party software supplied hereunder, your indemnification and defense rights, if any, shall be limited to those provided by such third party supplier. In addition to BlackBerry’s obligation to defend, and subject to the same conditions, BlackBerry shall pay all damages finally awarded against you by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent based upon an Infringement Claim. If the Software is, or BlackBerry determines in its sole discretion that it may be, subject to an Infringement Claim, BlackBerry reserves its right to terminate this agreement pursuant to Section O.
b.	Exclusions and Disclaimer.  Notwithstanding any other terms of this agreement, BlackBerry shall have no liability to you for any alleged or actual infringement arising out of or related to:  (i) use of Software in connection or in combination with equipment, devices or software not provided by BlackBerry; (ii) use of the Software in a manner for which it was not designed; (iii) any modification of the Software by anyone other than BlackBerry; (iv) compliance by BlackBerry with your designs, specifications, guidelines or instructions; (v) continued allegedly infringing activity by you after being notified thereof or being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement; or (vi) your access to or use of the Software after BlackBerry’s notice to you that you must cease use of such Software to avoid further infringement. In addition, BlackBerry shall not be responsible for any compromise or settlement of any Infringement Claim made by you without BlackBerry’s prior written consent.
c.	Sole and Exclusive Remedy.  THIS SECTION I PROVIDES YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AND BLACKBERRY’S ENTIRE LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM.

J.	Confidentiality:  
Except to the extent expressly permitted under this agreement, you shall not use or disclose to any third party any non-public information related to the Software or services including, without limitation, your use or testing of the Software or services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may disclose such information on a need to know basis to those of your employees and independent contractors who are subject to a legally enforceable obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such information.

K.	Privacy Policy:  
You consent to BlackBerry’s (including, without limitation, BlackBerry’s affiliates and suppliers) collection, processing, transmission and disclosure of any personally identifiable information or other data submitted by you or your Customers or end users to BlackBerry, in accordance with the terms specified in BlackBerry’s Privacy Policy, as BlackBerry may modify from time-to-time (“Privacy Policy”).

You will not download, distribute, or otherwise export or re-export Software: (i) into, or to a national or resident of, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria or any country to which the United States at any time in the future embargoes goods or restricts trade; or (ii) to anyone on the United States Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the United States Commerce Department’s Denied Persons, Denied Entities, and Unverified List.

M.	Intellectual Property:  
The Software and services are protected by U.S. and international copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights. BlackBerry shall retain all right, title, interest, ownership and other intellectual property rights in and to the Software and services. This agreement confers no title or ownership in the Software or services, or any rights therein. You may, but are not obligated to, provide BlackBerry suggestions, comments and feedback, in oral or written form, about the Software or services (“BlackBerry Feedback”), and in connection with providing such BlackBerry Feedback, you hereby grant BlackBerry, without charge, all right, title and interest necessary to use, share and commercialize the BlackBerry Feedback in any way and for any purpose and in BlackBerry’s sole discretion. If your Application is disclosed to BlackBerry for the purpose of any review, analysis or assistance as set forth herein, you grant to BlackBerry a revocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the Application in executable object code form, solely for such purpose and not for any other commercial use. The preceding sentence only grants a limited license and is not a sale of the Application or any portion or copy thereof, and BlackBerry obtains no right, title or interest from you under this agreement in or to any Applications that Developer develops. BlackBerry reserves any and all rights not expressly granted to you herein.

N.	Government End Users: 
The Software is a “Commercial Item”, as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Section 2.101, consisting of “Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer Software Documentation”, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. Section 12.212 or 48 C.F.R. Section 227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. Section 12.212 or 48 C.F.R. Section 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users: (i) only as Commercial Items; and (ii) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of the United States.

O.	Term and Termination: 
You may cease using the Software at any time with or without notice to BlackBerry.  Either party may terminate this agreement at any time for any reason by giving the other party at least sixty (60) days notice in writing. BlackBerry may terminate this agreement upon written notice to you if you breach any of its terms and fail to cure the breach within thirty (30) days following receipt of such written notice (if the breach is curable within such period). Upon the effective date of any expiration or termination of this agreement, and without further notice to you, the license to use the Software, any license to distribute the Software, and your right to access any services, shall immediately cease and you will destroy or delete any copies of the Software in your possession. The following Sections of this Agreement will survive its expiration or termination, howsoever occurring: A, C, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O and P.

P.	General:
a.	Assignment. You may not assign this agreement or any of your rights hereunder without BlackBerry’s prior written consent, which consent shall be subject to BlackBerry’s sole discretion. Any attempted assignment in breach of this provision will be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
b.	Governing Law; Equitable Relief; Attorneys’ Fees. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED, INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED, AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, UNITED STATES (EXCLUDING ITS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISIONS, THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS AND THE UNIFORM COMPUTER INFORMATION TRANSACTION ACT AND ANY ADAPTATION THEREOF).  The parties agree that damages will be an inadequate remedy in the case of your breach of certain terms of this agreement, and that BlackBerry may therefore seek equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have for such breach without the requirement of posting a bond. The prevailing party in any legal action related to this agreement is entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees and costs from the other party.
c.	Miscellaneous. Nothing in this agreement is intended to create a partnership, franchise, joint venture or agency relationship between the parties.  This agreement, together with any documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the complete agreement between the parties concerning its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations or understandings.  There are no intended third party beneficiaries of this agreement (except for BlackBerry’s affiliates and suppliers). If any of the provisions of this agreement are held to be in violation of applicable law, void, or unenforceable in any court of competent and appropriate jurisdiction, then such provisions are herewith waived to the extent necessary for this agreement to be otherwise enforceable in such jurisdiction. Any ambiguities herein will be clarified in an equitable manner without regard to authorship.  The provisions of this agreement may only be waived or modified in a writing signed by a representative of each party with authority to bind.   Neither party shall be deemed to be in default of any provisions of this agreement or for any failure in performance resulting from acts or events beyond the reasonable control of such party.
