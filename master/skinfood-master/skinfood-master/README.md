# SkinFood

I want to create an application to track my skin health relationship with my food consumption, because I didn't find one that fits my needs.

I'm using Vue.js so I can learn it and then use Weex so I can use it on my phone. I'm also studing Node.js and I'll probably use that for the "backend" part of my app.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
