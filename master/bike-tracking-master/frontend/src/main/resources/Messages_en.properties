faq.header=Frequently Asked Questions
faq.question1=Frequently Asked Questions
faq.answer1=Bike-Tracker is an all in one GPS tracking device, motion sensor and silent alarm that is built to be dust impervious and water resistant. Bike-Tracker will allow you to check the location of your motorcycle 24/7/365, wherever you are in the world. Can you see some of Bike-Tracker's features 'here'.
faq.question2=How does it work?
faq.answer2=The receiver in your Bike-Tracker uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) to track the location of your motorcycle. By default, once per minute whilst awake or once per hour whilst sleeping, your GPS receiver calculates it's location and sends an update to our infrastructure where your bikes location can then be seen in near real-time. In combination with the GPS receiver, Bike-Tracker contains a sensitive always active motion sensor which is used to trigger the silent alarm if movement is detected; you will be alerted by push notification through your mobile application, SMS message, or email if your Bike-Tracker detects movement when alarmed.
faq.question3=Can I use my Bike-Tracker on another motorcycle?
faq.answer3=Your Bike-Tracker can be installed on any motorcycle you wish -once purchased the device is yours and will function so long as you have an active subscription. If you own several motorcycles you can track them through the same user account and secure portal, and we offer a discounted price on multi-device purchases and multi-month subscriptions!
faq.question4=Will Bike-Tracker drain my battery?
faq.answer4=Bike-Tracker has an on-board battery which will limit it from draining your motorcycle battery. The internal battery can’t power the device indefinitely though, so Bike-Tracker will alert you if your motorcycle battery is being drained. Running your motorcycle for a short period will recharge Bike-Tracker’s internal battery.
faq.question5=How do I fit my Bike-Tracker?
faq.answer5=Bike-Tracker is simple to install as long as you have access to the right tools. You can find suggested fitting instructions here, but if you are not confident enough to fit it yourself then our recommendation is to have professional install your Bike-Tracker.
faq.question6=If my motorcycle is stolen, what do I do?
faq.answer6=If your Bike-Tracker alerts you to unauthorised movement our recommendation is to confirm whether your motorcycle has been stolen. If it has, contact the local authorities on 101 and provide them the short URL reference that is generated through your Secure Portal. This will give the authorities the ability to track and recover your motorcycle.
faq.question7=Do I have to purchase for notifications?
faq.answer7=Bike-Tracker allows an unlimited number of worldwide notifications inclusive of your subscription cost.
