# Chapter 11: Mastering Concurrent Processes with core.async

[`playsync`](playsync) contains all the functions and definitions
listed in the chapter, and [`code.clj`](code) has the examples of the
functions being used, as well as other snippets. The `playsync`
project is a little funky because it's not really a project. It just
makes it more convenient to use core.async functions, and it does this
by putting the functions in namespace that refers the core.async
functions.
