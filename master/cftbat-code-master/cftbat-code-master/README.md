# Clojure for the Brave and True Code

This contains all the code examples from the book Clojure for the
Brave and True, which you can read at http://braveclojure.com. Also check 
out the print version at https://nostarch.com/clojure! 

This repo is organized by chapter, with the `01` directory corresponding to 
chapter 1, `02` chapter 2 - you get the idea. Each directory has its own
README with additional notes.

Have fun!
