# Chapter 5: Functional Programming

The main project at the end of the chapter, Peg Thing, is here: https://github.com/flyingmachine/pegthing. Examples of using Peg Thing functions are in [`code.clj`](code.clj), along with the rest of the clojure snippets.

Inferior JavaScript examples are in [`code.js`](code.js). There's some Ruby code in [`code.rb`](code.rb).
