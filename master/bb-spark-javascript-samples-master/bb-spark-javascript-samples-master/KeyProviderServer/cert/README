This folder contains placeholders for the certificate and private key. Replace
these files with PEM encoded files suitable for use in establishing a TLS
context as per the key and cert options described here:
https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v6.x/api/tls.html#tls_tls_createsecurecontext_options

Include the full path to these files in config.js.

If you want to start KeyProviderServer in http mode, then set 'useSsl' to false
in config.js file.
