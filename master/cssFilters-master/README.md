### Improvements and Bugs

Please feel free to open a new issue [here](https://github.com/Ghosh/cssFilters/issues) with your suggestions or any bugs which you may have come across.

### Contributing

Incase you want to contribute to the source code, clone/download this repo and build the project locally. You would need to have `node` and `gulp` installed on your machine.

There is only one gulp task which you would need - `gulp go`. This handles all the compiling and setup tasks. It accepts two optional flags:-
* `--open` - Opens the project in your default browser after compilation
* `--build` - Minifies and optimizes the stylesheets and scripts

These flags can be passed together also. For example:- `gulp go --build --open`. This will open the browser and run the watch task in production mode.
