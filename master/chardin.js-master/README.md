# Chardin.js

**Simple overlay instructions for your apps.**

[Check out a demo](http://heelhook.github.com/chardin.js/).

Chardin.js is a jQuery plugin that creates a simple overlay to display instructions on existent elements. It is inspired by
the recent Gmail new composer tour which I loved.

## Installing

Simple! Fork this repo or download [chardinjs.css][0] and [chardinjs.min.js][1] and add the following assets to your HTML:

```HTML
<link href="chardinjs.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="chardinjs.min.js"></script>
```

### Installing in the rails asset pipeline (optional) 

There's a [`chardinjs-rails`](https://github.com/heelhook/chardin.js-rails) gem.

### Building (optional)

If you choose to fork the repo you can build the assets running

    rake compile


## Adding data for the instructions

Add the instructions to your elements:

`data-intro`: Text to show with the instructions  
`data-position`: (`left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`), where to place the text with respect to the element

```HTML
<img src="img/chardin.png" data-intro="An awesome 18th-century painter, who found beauty in everyday, common things." data-position="right" />
```

## Running

Once you have your elements ready you can show instructions running

```Javascript
$('body').chardinJs('start')
```

If you would rather run ChardinJs confined to a particular container (instead of using the whole document) you can
change `body` to some other selector.

```Javascript
$('.container').chardinJs('start')
```

You may also refresh instructions overlay any time to reflect whatever changes happened to the underlying page elements since the instructions overlay has been displayed.

```Javascript
var chardinOverlay = $('body').chardinJs('start');
...
chardinOverlay.refresh();
```

## Methods

### .chardinJs('start')

Start ChardinJs in the selector.

### .chardinJs('toggle')

Toggle ChardinJs.

### .chardinJs('stop')

Make your best guess. That's right! Stops ChardinJs in the selector.

## Events

### 'chardinJs:start'

Triggered when chardinJs is correctly started.

### 'chardinJs:stop'

Triggered when chardinJs is stopped.
