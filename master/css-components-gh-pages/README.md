## Browser Support

Chrome | Firefox | Internet Explorer | Opera | Safari | Edge |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
Android | Yes | Yes | N/A | Untested | N/A | N/A |
iOS | No | N/A | N/A | Untested | Yes |N/A |
Mac OS X | Yes | Yes | N/A | Untested |Yes |N/A |
Windows   | Yes | Yes | Yes (9+) | Untested | Yes | Yes |

| |Internet Explorer   |
|---|---|
| Carousel |9+ * |
| Collapse |9+ * |
| Dropdown |9+ * |
| Modal |9+ * |
| Tab | 9+ * |
| Tooltip | 8+ * ** |

\* [CSS3 transitions](http://caniuse.com/#search=css%20transition) are not supported in IE8 and below.
** Janky z-index. See [tooltip on right example](http://www.felipefialho.com/css-components/#component-tooltip).

**Notes:**
* Most tests performed with Browserstack.
* Components that perform action on hover may not work on touchscreens eg. *dropdown with hover*. Oddly *tooltip* does work. Bootstrap mentions this, “[Sticky :hover/:focus on mobile.](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support-sticky-hover-mobile)
Even though real hovering isn't possible on most touchscreens, most mobile browsers emulate hovering support and make :hover ‘sticky’. In other words, :hover styles start applying after tapping an element and only stop applying after the user taps some other element.”
* Probably the main reason why the components fail in earlier versions of IE is because they use [advanced CSS selectors](http://caniuse.com/#search=CSS3%20selectors) which aren’t supported. It may be possible to patch this with the use of something like [selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com). This may defeat the purpose of using these javascript free components but on the other hand it may be acceptable for older IE.
* The components do not fail gracefully. In most cases some elements are visible but interaction will not have any effect. The *carousel* component won't show anything.
* Some layout issues with *tab* when wrapping on smaller screen sizes.
* Weird flash when *carousel* loops around to first slide.
