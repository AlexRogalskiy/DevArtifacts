				<p>A thrill of horror flashed through every soul upon the plantation,
				excepting Mr. Gore. He alone seemed cool and collected. He was asked by
				Colonel Lloyd and my old master, why he resorted to this extraordinary
				expedient. His reply was, (as well as I can remember,) that Demby had
				become unmanageable. He was setting a dangerous example to the other
				slaves,--one which, if suffered to pass without some such demonstration
				on his part, would finally lead to the total subversion of all rule and
				order upon the plantation. He argued that if one slave refused to be
				corrected, and escaped with his life, the other slaves would soon copy
				the example; the result of which would be, the freedom of the slaves,
				and the enslavement of the whites. Mr. Gore's defence was satisfactory.
				He was continued in his station as overseer upon the home plantation.
				His fame as an overseer went abroad. His horrid crime was not even
				submitted to judicial investigation. It was committed in the presence of
				slaves, and they of course could neither institute a suit, nor testify
				against him; and thus the guilty perpetrator of one of the bloodiest
				and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice, and uncensured by the
				community in which he lives. Mr. Gore lived in St. Michael's, Talbot
				county, Maryland, when I left there; and if he is still alive, he very
				probably lives there now; and if so, he is now, as he was then, as
				highly esteemed and as much respected as though his guilty soul had not
				been stained with his brother's blood.</p>
				<p>The wife of Mr. Giles Hicks, living but a short distance from where I
				used to live, murdered my wife's cousin, a young girl between fifteen
				and sixteen years of age, mangling her person in the most horrible
				manner, breaking her nose and breastbone with a stick, so that the poor
				girl expired in a few hours afterward. She was immediately buried, but
				had not been in her untimely grave but a few hours before she was taken
				up and examined by the coroner, who decided that she had come to her
				death by severe beating. The offence for which this girl was thus
				murdered was this:--She had been set that night to mind Mrs. Hicks's
				baby, and during the night she fell asleep, and the baby cried. She,
				having lost her rest for several nights previous, did not hear the
				crying. They were both in the room with Mrs. Hicks. Mrs. Hicks, finding
				the girl slow to move, jumped from her bed, seized an oak stick of wood
				by the fireplace, and with it broke the girl's nose and breastbone,
				and thus ended her life. I will not say that this most horrid murder
				produced no sensation in the community. It did produce sensation, but
				not enough to bring the murderess to punishment. There was a warrant
				issued for her arrest, but it was never served. Thus she escaped not
				only punishment, but even the pain of being arraigned before a court for
				her horrid crime.</p>
