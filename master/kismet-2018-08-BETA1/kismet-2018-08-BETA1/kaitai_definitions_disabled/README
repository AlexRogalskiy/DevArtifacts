KAITAI DEFINITIONS
Currently disabled

As of 2018-01, Kaitai generates memory-unsafe C++ code which can cause significant
memory leaks when handling invalid buffers.

This makes these parsers unusable in a long-running service such as Kismet.

The definitions remain as a resource for the future when Kaitai may become 
usable for C++ again.
