Kismet Debug Service

# Purpose

    The Kismet debug service runs Kismet, via systemd, in debug mode.  Logs of full
    thread and backtrace info are stored in /var/log/kismet-debug-[timestamp].log.

# Installing

    You'll need to install two files:

        $ sudo cp kismet_debug /usr/local/bin/
        $ sudo cp kismet-debug.service /lib/systemd/system/
        
    You will also need to make the directory for the Kismet debug logs:

        $ sudo mkdir /var/log/kismet

    If you have installed Kismet to a different prefix, such as /usr, you'll need
    to adjust the directory you copy kismet_debug to accordingly.

# Configuring

    By default, the Kismet systemd service runs Kismet as root; this is NOT best practices
    but it is the only user consistently available.

    It is STONGLY recommended that you install Kismet as suid-root via `make suidinstall`,
    and that you run Kismet as a non-privileged user.  Kismet will then limit root 
    access to the capture binaries which control individual interfaces.

    To set up Kismet to run as a user, first follow the install directions in the Kismet
    README file, and install the Kismet systemd service as above.  Then, use the
    `systemctl edit` command to configure the Kismet server; for instance if you want to
    run Kismet as the user 'kismet':

        $ sudo systemctl edit kismet

    `systemctl edit` will open an editor; set the following options:

        [Service]
        User=kismet
        Group=kismet

    and save.  Now systemd will start Kismet as the 'kismet' user.  If you want to 
    automatically start Kismet as some other user (such as the one you normally log in as), 
    put that user in the User= line.

    For debug mode, you will also need to make the debug log directory writeable by the
    user you're running Kismet as; the easiest way to accomplish this is:

        $ sudo chown kismet /var/log/kismet

    If you're running Kismet under a different user, use that username instead, of course.

# Activating

    If you have configured Kismet as a normal systemd service (using kismet.service),
    you MUST DISABLE IT before running Kismet as a debug service!

    To start Kismet via systemd:

        $ sudo service kismet-debug start

    To start Kismet, with debugging, by default on boot:

        $ sudo systemctl enable kismet-debug
