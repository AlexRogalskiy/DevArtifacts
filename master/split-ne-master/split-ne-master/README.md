Tool that divide complex named entitities in Czech into their parts 

Our target are sequences like (hokejista - hockey player) New York Rangers Jaromír Jágr. In this case, it is clear for human that name of the hockey player is not the whole sequence. It is not so clear for computers, so we are trying to develop an quantitative method based on frequencies on large corpus that could do that.
