RabbitVCS Thunar Extension

This extension is meant to be used with the Thunar File Manager.  Bear in mind that
Thunar's extension framework does not allow the setting of emblems so file statuses
will not be overlayed like it does on Nautilus.

Requirements:
    * thunar (>= v0.4.0)
    * thunarx-python (>= v0.2.0)
    * dbus-python (>= 0.80)
    * (all other RabbitVCS requirements)

To install:
    If you are running Thunar v1.1.0 or later, copy RabbitVCS.py to:
        /usr/lib/thunarx-2/python or /usr/lib64/thunarx-2/python
    
    If you are running Thunar < v1.1.0, copy RabbitVCS.py to:
        /usr/lib/thunarx-1/python or /usr/lib64/thunarx-2/python
        
    In both cases, you may need to create the python folder.  Some systems like Fedora use /usr/lib64 on 64-bit systems.
