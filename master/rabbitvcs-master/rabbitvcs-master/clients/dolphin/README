RabbitVCS Dolphin/KDE4 Extension (EXPERIMENTAL!)

This extension is meant to be used with the Dolphin File Manager which comes with KDE 4.x

Requirements:
    * KDE 4
    * (all other RabbitVCS requirements)

To install:
    Copy all supplied .desktop files to:
        /usr/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/
    
    Alternatively you can copy the files to the kde4-directory inside your $HOME, i.e. on Ubuntu 14.04:
        /home/your-username/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/
        
    In the second case, you may need to create the ServiceMenus folder.
    Please note that the name (i.e. .kde or .kde4) depends on your OS distribution.
