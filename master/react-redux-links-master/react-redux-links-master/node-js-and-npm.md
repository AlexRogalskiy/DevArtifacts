### Node.js and NPM

Note: it is HIGHLY recommended that you install Node 5.x, particularly if you are on Windows.  Node 5.x 
includes NPM 3.x, which fixes many problems working with packages on Windows.  Also, you will want to use 
NPM 3.7 or later, as that fixes a bug with the progress bar that drastically slowed down installations.
