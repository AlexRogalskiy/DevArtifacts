## Limitations
Each button needs its own filter element (changing filter properties will apply to every element affected by that respective filter). If you want to have multiple buttons with the same effect on your page, you can generate the `<filter>` element dynamically in JavaScript like explained in [Lucas Bebber's tutorial](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/04/08/motion-blur-effect-svg/).

Some buttons have specific limitations:

- #01: Needs to have a plain background (works with transparent but the effect may be different)
- #02: Needs to have a border/box-shadow of the same color as the background

## Browser Support
Effects have been tested on Chrome and Firefox only. Safari doesn't support CSS filters and a specific fallback has been applied.
