Digital Legibility, a book based on my dissertation.

The full title of this 44 page book is “An Examination into the Significance of Legibility in Digital Typography”. The red, green and blue lines on the front cover are an interpretation of the way pixels are arranged on LCD screens. This book was an exercise in grid structure, type hierarchy and overall composition to celebrate the completion of my BA (Hons) Graphic Design course.
