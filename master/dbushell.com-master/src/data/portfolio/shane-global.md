Friendly colours and icons proved to be a great solution for attracting a wide audience of students. The **Shane Global** navigation was designed to accommodate a large amount of content in an easily accessible and structured manor.

The colour coding, breadcrumbs and repetition of elements across the bottom of the page all help to guide visitors to the content they're looking for.
