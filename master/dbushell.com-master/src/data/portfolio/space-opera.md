Space Opera is my response to the 2008 D&AD student brief of the same name.

The brief asked me to “Create a striking new look for the [Space Opera] book series”. I wanted to get away from the cliché illustration style of most modern sci-fi books so I kept the designs very typographic. I printed on matt paper then screen-printed extra elements with a translucent pearlescent ink that shimmers on the surface. Typography choices are influenced by retro sci-fi like Buck Rogers and Asimov's novels, as is the worn and torn aesthetic. This look contrasts with the pearl ink making the books look timeless.
