If you were to stakeout my desk you will hear me shout out expletives 4 or 5 times a day. And if something has really thrown me, I'll [tweet](http://twitter.com/dbushell) about it.

I am (of course) refering to bad user interface design.

I'm an avid subscriber to the blog [Adobe UI Gripes](http://adobegripes.tumblr.com/) because it makes me feel slighty better knowing I only use 3 pieces of Adobe software when others need to use the whole collection. I have so many minor issues with Photoshop I take a deep breath and count to ten before I power up in the morning. The positives probably outway the negatives in this situation but what kind of wierdo randomly shouts out in praise for UI during normal office hours? Being a software UI designer must suck.

This week I discovered [Finer Things in Mac](http://finerthingsinmac.com/) which celeberates all the good stuff. I felt something odd when I first saw the blog. Almost enlightened. It's a breath of fresh air.

And then I went back to taming Photoshop.
