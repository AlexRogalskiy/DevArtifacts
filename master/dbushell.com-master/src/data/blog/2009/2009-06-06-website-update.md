dbushell.com has a brand new look!

The previous version of my website was created just before graduation to showcase my design portfolio. Now just over a year later I've finally found time to update it. The new look and layout is a lot more sophisticated and provides room for my new [blog](/blog/) and other projects that are in the pipeline. It's built on [Habari](http://habariproject.org).

Please leave a comment below and let me know what you think!
