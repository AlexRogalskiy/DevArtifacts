Heading to the cinema to watch Transformers 2 yesterday afternoon I saw something that turned out to be far more interesting than the film. The giant  " A  R  T  " (pictured below) certainly caught my eye as I walked over the West India Quay bridge. After more research apparently it's there for an upcoming arts festival ([1](http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/whatson/west-india-quay-festival-article-8348.html), [2](http://www.westindiaquaycentre.co.uk/events.cfm)). I'll be there to watch the stilt walkers - the docklands doesn't really offer the flattest of ground to maneuver.

On a minor note I don't like the extreme [tracking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_(typography)) used. The spacing makes the whole installation look slightly amateurish (I need to turn my typography brain off sometimes).

As for Transformers 2 - surprising amount of ball jokes. The story line leaves much to be desired with another [magical artifact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina) that was the solution to everything. But great action and amazing graphics I'd watch it again just because robots are awesome.
