Secret Blisters screen print poster show at Print Club London - 35 artists, 35 limited edition prints, 35 pounds each.

Friday night I went to Print Club London in Dalston (London E8) to see the Secret Blisters screen print gallery (photos below). I was expecting a good night but the showcase was incredible. Thankfully it was cash-only because there were several prints I had my eye on and my debit card would have taken a big hit for the team. I walked away with just the one print that will soon be framed and replacing the Ikea clone above my bed.

<p class="quote">We are bringing together a mixture of 35 emerging and established illustrators from pen to mouse to those who cover walls, for another summer bonanza of hand pulled, screen printed posters.</p>


For more information see the [Print Club London](http://www.printclublondon.com/secretblisters_info.php) website. Apparently any unsold prints will be sold online from Monday 29th June. I'd be surprised if there are any left though!
