title: Most Amazing Top 2
---

I'm subscribed to ~50-60 RSS feeds in Google Reader, most of them are design related. I also follow hundreds of design related people (and 1 meerkat) on Twitter. I like being up-to-date. I recently started the website [Design Heroes](http://designheroes.co.uk) so I could bookmark the best of the best. The rules for Design Heroes are decidedly simple:


* Rule #1 - links have to be design related .
* Rule #2 - links cannot start with "Top 100...", "50 Excellent..."25+ Amazing Super Awesome..."


Simple, you would have thought. But rules #2 cuts out 90% of my daily intake. What's the deal with the online design community today? There is no creativity in naming articles, it's just lists and lists and more lists. It looks like a robot has generated half the content in my RSS reader.

Here's my much anticipated **top 2** reasons why you shouldn't use lists (drumroll please):


### Reason 1


It's not creative and looks like regurgitated spam.


### Reason 2


It's bloody annoying!!
