Waterstones book display - some very eye catching book designs.

London Underground has decided to [strike today for 48 hours](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8090608.stm) which has slightly inconvenienced my journey to and from work. Rather than getting terribly angry about the whole situation I'm going to take it as a challenge to see more of London (probably from a bus window).

Today fairly unplanned I stopped by Waterstones at Canary Wharf to pick up 3 for 2 and some points on my loyalty card. The points seemed to have been hit worse than the pound in the "current economic climate" but enjoyably I did see this great book display (pictured below).

Space Opera is a series of classic Sci-Fi books republished with designs from a D&AD student competition. These are completely different to my entries but are very nice indeed. The black & white style will stand out very well when they're on the shelf and it creates an eye catching old/new appearance. I'm slightly glad now that I didn't win the competition because my wallet would certainly be a whole lot lighter tonight.
