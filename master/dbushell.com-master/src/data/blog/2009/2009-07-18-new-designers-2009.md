[New Designers](http://www.newdesigners.com/) is an intriguing exhibition that incorporates a wide array of design practices over the two weeks it runs at the Business Design Centre, London.



<p class="quote">Nowhere else is it possible to see such creativity across every major design discipline from architecture to animation, furniture to fashion, graphics to glass.</p>

It takes place in the building I work so there's no excuse for me missing anything... I did miss the fashion and contemporary arts week however. So I decided to sacrifice a lunch break to see the product, furniture and miscellaneous design categories week.

Here's six things I liked.

![Origami](/images/blog/new-designers/origami.jpg)
Every portfolio needs an origami crane. Preferably green though.

![Fabric](/images/blog/new-designers/fabric.jpg)
This curtain-like thing was very cool. Looks like it could be morphed into any shape.

![Books](/images/blog/new-designers/books.jpg)
It's tempting to ask a printer to quote for this.

![Glass](/images/blog/new-designers/glass.jpg)
I didn't think they literally meant glass, but here we are. A lot more eye catching in person when you look through at different angles.

![Chairs](/images/blog/new-designers/chairs.jpg)
These look really comfortable.

![Elephant](/images/blog/new-designers/elephant.jpg)
Very novel. One of the few things there that I can see selling.
