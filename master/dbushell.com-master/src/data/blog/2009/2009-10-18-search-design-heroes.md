If you visit [Design Heroes](http://designheroes.co.uk) you'll notice an extra tab in the top menu called "Extras". This page will include new and experimental features that are added as the site grows.

The latest feature is a keyword search. Design Heroes is normally browsed by selecting the tags (listed on the left-hand side) but I think a search will be useful sometimes. For example, search for "David" and you'll find me! I don't think I deserve my own tag though :) The keyword(s) you enter are searched for within the bookmark titles and descriptions.

Search will remain in the "Extras" tab until it's been tested properly and fully integrated. I'm working on a more intuitive interface. I'm also looking at AJAX-ing the whole thing, if I find time.

Anyway it's Sunday afternoon and Man City are losing so I have somewhere else to be!
