The City can be a bit dull at times. Let's splash more colour around.


Friday I walked past [YCN's](http://www.ycnonline.com) new studio space and saw the window display they have up. It's such a great installation, I'll definitely have to return when they're open to look inside.

### And on a different note...


...and in an entirely different part of town I snapped a photo of this Lamborghini at the Motorexpo, Canary Wharf. A fitting colour for the location. I'm not a car person but I want one of these to complement the other expensive things I don't own.
