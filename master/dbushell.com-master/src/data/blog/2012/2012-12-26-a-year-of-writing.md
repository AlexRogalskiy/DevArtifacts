They say a [monkey hitting keys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) at random will reproduce the works of Shakespeare, eventually. I only had a year but I did manage to produce _something_ worthy of sharing. Here's a recap of my best efforts, as inadvertently voted by you:

I'm happy to see that live case studies, usable resources, and practical code/commentary are most popular. Despite publishing 50 articles this year I have double that number of abandoned drafts. That's a lot of wasted time! That demands a change in strategy; more frequent writing and more concise topics.

Stay tuned and thanks for the sharing. I have big news in January…
