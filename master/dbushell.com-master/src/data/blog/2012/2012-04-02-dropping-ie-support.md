title: Dropping IE Support
---

Yesterday [TechCrunch reported](http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/01/bootstrapped-startup-saves-over-100k-by-dropping-ie/) on the start-up **4ormat** and their decision to drop support for **Internet Explorer** entirely. Their logic behind this seems simple enough; developing for IE users did not equate to profit.


<blockquote><p>Supporting variants of IE can easily increase design work by 30% to 100%, but complex features can easily double (or even triple) development time. It doesn’t take many developer salaries before this “IE tax” can cost you well over $100,000.</p></blockquote>


Aside from profit, other benefits listed were: employee satisfaction, productivity, and shorter release cycles.

Open Web evangelists will rage at this idea. Accessibility for all is a cornerstone of good website development. The phrase "best view in..." keeps rearing its ugly head. The idea of "only viewable in..." is even worse.

There are two precedents that I find very worrying here:

1. [Browser support](/2012/03/03/forget-about-browser-support/) should never be boolean. Except when the number of potential users is minuscule (e.g. IE 6 in most cases), at which point testing is clearly unprofitable. A tiered visual and functional experience based on feature detection should exist, i.e. progressive enhancement. Any individual browser or device accessing a website is irrelevant in regards to "support"; there are just _too many_.
2. **Internet Explorer is not that difficult to develop for.** Sure, IE is the butt of all jokes, but the reality is a competent front-end developer should be able to deliver something accessible (based on point 1 above). If IE "doubles" or "triples" your development time then consider hiring new developers.


Ultimately, website owners can do what they choose. I think an idea like actively blocking Internet Explorer is stupid but it's not my business decision to make.

It does, however, set a dangerous example to those who make websites.

If you're a so-called _website designer_ or _website developer_ then stop bitching.** Learn to do your job**. It's irresponsible towards your employer to project such a negative light on one browser just because you lack the skills to do your job properly.

Rather than whining like a baby when you're pulled out of your cosy Apple eco-system full of Webkit-based browsers and high resolution devices, face the real world. Recognise that a little bit of hard work and less fun goes a long, long way.
