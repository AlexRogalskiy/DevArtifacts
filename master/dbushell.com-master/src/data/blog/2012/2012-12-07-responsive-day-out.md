<blockquote><p>It’s a kind of conference, I guess, but I think of it as more like a gathering of like-minded people getting together to share what they’ve learned, show some examples, swap techniques, and discuss problems. And all of it will be related to responsive web design.</p></blockquote>


Ordinarily, I'm not one for speaking gigs but this was an opportunity I couldn't refuse. Very honoured to be in the line-up. I'll be partaking in a quick fire 20 minute presentation with Q&A afterwards. I'm super excited because if I had my way, this would be the topic of every conference (probably a good thing I don't get my own way).

It'll be a while before I finalise my 20 minutes (haven't started yet), but it's a sure bet I'll be showing off responsive techniques for common/advanced design patterns. I'll demo the principles and keep the code light (you can inspect that online later).

If you're heading to Brighton [give me a shout](http://twitter.com/dbushell). I'll certainly try to accomodate any specific design/build questions.

If you're wondering what my credentials are my focus for the last two years has been [making](/2012/06/17/passenger-focus-responsive-web-design-case-study/), [blogging](/?s=responsive), and selling to clients all things responsive/device-independent.
