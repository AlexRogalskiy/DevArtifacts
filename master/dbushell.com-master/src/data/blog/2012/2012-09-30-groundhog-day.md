"ahhhhhh!"

— is what I [tweeted](http://twitter.com/dbushell/status/252499830750982144) on this fine Sunday evening. (And some people choose not to follow me?) What provoked this dramatic outburst was every designers' worst nightmare; a sudden urge to "redesign" their website.

[June 2009](/2009/06/06/website-update/), [August 2009](/2009/08/26/redesign-or-realign/), [June 2010](/2010/06/26/dbushell-v4/), [May 2011](/2011/05/25/designing-a-new-me/), [February 2012](/2012/02/27/spring-cleaning-redesigning-dbushell-com/). At this point the cycle is hardly a surprise and I guess I should embrace the prospect rather than tweet about it. Last time I said:


<blockquote><p>A complete overhaul of the build and a touch of class to the design. You’re seeing it now (unless you’ve arrived here from a future redesign. In that case, how long did this one last?)</p></blockquote>


About seven months then? I'm actually _really_ happy with my current iteration. It concluded an idea and style I'd be honing for several years. At some point along the journey I even stumbling upon the value of adding screenshots to each launch article (makes for a less confusing read in retrospective).

So why the change of heart?

I just feel there's something too _formal_ about this design. It's too easy. At every angle it says "blog" and that's boring. A product rooted firmly in history. In one sense this design does a perfect job — analytics and feedback agree — and I'll feel hard pressed to let it go, but I also sense an opportunity to do something radical, something [positively modern](/2012/09/25/what-is-the-medium/) — that I can't ignore.

Whatever _is_ next will be online soon. I've already built an early prototype and I like where it is going. This is my biggest platform to experiment with and I know you'll be very vocal about the result. I look forward to that! In the meantime, tell me your personal design story. I know I'm not the only redesign addict.
