I've just uploaded <del>a developer preview of</del> **[Socialite v2.0](https://github.com/dbushell/Socialite)** over at GitHub.

[Socialite](http://socialitejs.com) allows you to delay the loading of social sharing buttons (which aren't very popular at the moment [[1]](http://informationarchitects.net/blog/sweep-the-sleaze/) [[2]](http://www.netmagazine.com/news/drop-social-media-buttons-call-121990)). This speeds up the load of important content dramatically. It also means you can initialise new buttons for dynamically loaded content at any time. Version 2 introduces more widget support, less bugs and conflicts, and language config, and callback events for successful likes, tweets and plusones. More features are on the way! Stay tuned for further announcements.

Thanks for all the help and feedback so far :)
