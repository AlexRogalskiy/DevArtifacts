title: Resolution Independence!

One of my thoughts for [Web Design: 2012 and Beyond](/2011/12/15/web-design-2012-and-beyond/) concerned the issues of **screen resolution** and the necessity for **scalable graphics** on the web. As part of that thinking I've written a piece for Smashing Magazine entitled [Resolution Independence with SVG](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/16/resolution-independence-with-svg/):


<blockquote><p>When we look at the breadth of Web-enabled devices, responsive design is sure to provide a better user experience. Scrolling horizontally, panning and zooming the viewport have their place in user interface design, but forcing the user to do these things just to navigate a website quickly becomes tedious. Fitting the website to the viewport is about more than just layout: it’s also about resolution. In this article, I’ll demonstrate why SVG is a perfect addition to future-friendly Web development.</p></blockquote>


I go on to demonstrate how SVG can be used in place of normal image techniques. I first experimented with [using SVG logos](/2010/06/30/using-svg-logos/) in 2010 but browser support was very limiting back then. Towards the end of 2011 I had [another look at SVG logos](/2011/11/11/the-good-the-bad-and-the-logo/) and was surprised by the progress — that led to this article!

Of course, I'm not the only one considering these challenges. It's great to see other designers/developers like [Laura Kalbag](http://laurakalbag.com/) realising the same potential (check out her site for [Future Insights](http://futureinsightslive.com/) for SVG icons). I expect such practice will become common place soon. Other techniques also exist for scalable graphics, many using CSS alone (I've listed a few in [my article](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/16/resolution-independence-with-svg/)). 300 pixel-per-inch tablets and laptops within a year or two? Make sure your websites are ready.
