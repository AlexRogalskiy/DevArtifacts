My bookmark blog [Design Heroes](http://designheroes.co.uk) has built quite a following over the last few years — who said RSS was dead? — but being more active on Twitter ([@dbushell](http://twitter.com/dbushell)) has made this blog redundant (and a pain to maintain).

Design Heroes was my "original" web project so I've been hesitant to let it die but lack of time has inevitably seen that happen anyway! It was a great website to experiment with, the first one I ever built with "HTML5". I'll keep it online as an archive and post/tweet further resources from now on. I have a few ideas to present those tweets beyond the fire hose too. While those ideas are in the think factory I'm using [ThinkUp](http://thinkupapp.com/) to own _my_ data. Don't expect it back from Twitter anytime soon!

So thanks to everyone who supported Design Heroes, make sure to follow me on Twitter for further bookmarks!
