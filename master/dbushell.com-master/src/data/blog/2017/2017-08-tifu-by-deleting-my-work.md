Ever get that feeling youâ€™ve lost something?

<p class="b-post__image">![me after deleting two daysâ€™ work](/images/blog/scared-spongebob.gif)</p>

Iâ€™ve long been a paying user of CodePen. Itâ€™s nice for sharing snippets, quick mock-ups, or messing around with code. [CodePen Projects](https://codepen.io/pro/projects) is a newish addition. It provides a more complete development environment.

A mini-project came along for a client that gave me the perfect excuse to try CodePen Projects.

Development was smooth. Right up until my main JavaScript file disappeared. I canâ€™t say for sure why. I was dragging files around. Renaming stuff. The UI started to feel a little clunky. I had several instances of the project open. All I know is my file had vanished. A bug? Most likely my own stupidity. No way of knowing for sure. All I know is there was a distinct lack of two dayâ€™s worth of JavaScript.

It was good code too, Iâ€™d even commented it.

The slow realisation that I may have to rewrite everything from memory was agonising. Refusing that fate, I thought long and hardâ€¦

Chromeâ€™s cache!

I navigated to `chrome://cache/` (in Chrome, obviously). A quick search found the JavaScript file Iâ€™d lost. I then converted the hex dump to binary ([this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31616371) provided a solution). These hex dumps look like they can contain gzipped data, so an extra step may be necessary to decode. I didnâ€™t have too.

Iâ€™m very lucky!

Iâ€™m also â€” for the time being â€” returning to my offline editor which can backup and commit to source control. I do love me some CodePen, it's not to blame here, but for larger projects I'm not comfortable without backups.

I was thinking of writing a script to make pulling files from the browser cache easier. But ensuring I'll never need to again is time better spent.

Be careful out there!
