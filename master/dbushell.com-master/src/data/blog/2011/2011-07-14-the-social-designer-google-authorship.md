Earlier this month I wrote an article about **self promotion online** as a designer (read [Speak to Me](http://xheight.dbushell.com/2011/07/03/speak-to-me-self-promotion-online/) over at xheight). I summed it up to this sentiment:


<blockquote><p>Self promotion is not about pushing an ego onto others, it’s simply about making yourself visible and accessible.</p></blockquote>


One thing I realised quickly in my career is the importance of having a consistent public profile. There’s no point running a Tumblr blog if no one associates it with you. When **Google+** launched a few weeks ago I registered my usual black & white headshot and made sure to link [my profile](https://plus.google.com/112664170427933857280/) across the web—from Twitter to dbushell.com—BOOM! An extension to my online persona.


## Google Authorship


But a Google profile is more than your normal web presence:

<p class="small">![Google search for "Circle me" showing an author profile](/images/2011/07/google-social-search.png)Google search for "Circle me".</p>

What you're seeing in the first search result is the [Google Authorship](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=1229920) program in action. Because my blog links to my Google+ profile reciprocally, Google knows I'm the author of that page and shows my mugshot. With the right development I can link to my profile on every website I publish content for. See [Graham Smith's guide to Google Authorship](http://imjustcreative.com/implementing-google-authorship-markup-on-your-website/2011/07/07/) for a designer-friendly introduction.

<p class="medium">The second search result promotes a link I've shared as a +1 recommendation. (It happens to be my _other_ blog linking to the same article, but that's not the point!)</p>




## Open to the Public


No hiding now! Promoting yourself online is a big commitment. With such a strong public profile it's a dangerous game. There's a level of professional integrity that can be easily damaged with poorly written criticism (or a drunken tweet).

In reality though, the "privacy" of the past has always been an illusion. Whatever information I make public is just that; **public**.  It doesn't matter whether I whisper it in a friends ear or publish it online—it's out there. For that reason I think this heightened level of online promotion will be a good thing. I'll be far more conscious of what I make public and will wield a lot more power for self promotion.

For those working in the web industry, is it possible to stay behind the curtain?
