I've been the **Senior Web Designer** (and front-end dev) at [Base Creative, London](http://www.basecreative.eu) for the last three years. I've worked on great projects with amazing clients, making the Web that little bit better.

But sadly nothing can stay the same forever, and despite fond memories, I've decided to move on.

Next Monday I'll be joining **[Browser Creative](http://www.browsercreative.com/)**, continuing with web design and front-end development. Their ambition, positive spirit and desire to produce a perfect online experience was just too tempting to turn down. The opportunity ahead to make, well, just plain awesome (and semantic; accessible) shiny web-stuff is an exciting prospect. The web is a wonderful place to work.

I owe a big thank you to all the guys who made Base Creative a special place to be, I'll miss you!

I considered setting up on my own, a freelance and web entrepreneur combo — I have a few online start-up ideas — but they can wait! Agency life is where I belong right now, with the big clients and fast pace. I think it's a nice time to review my personal projects too, I've wrestled a couple of days free!

I've never been the sort to plan ahead personally (how did I end up in London anyway?) so I guess I better get started writing the next chapter...
