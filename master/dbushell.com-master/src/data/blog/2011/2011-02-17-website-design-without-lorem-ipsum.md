title: Design without Lorem Ipsum
---

Back in [August 2009](/2009/08/31/designing-with-placeholder-text/) I made a vow never to use [Lorem Ipsum](http://lipsum.com/) again!

Partly because I could recite more words of *Lorem Ipsum* than I could numbers of *Pi*, but mainly because I noticed it encouraged bad design habits and impeded feedback and discussion in client meetings.

I don't agree with some of my thoughts from 2009, but this reasoning still stands:


<blockquote><p>The problem with using Lorem Ipsum is that it doesn’t give a proper sense or provoke thoughts as to what will eventually replace it.</p></blockquote>


So has a year sober of Lorem Ipsum been beneficial?

I can say unequivocally that designing websites **without Lorem Ipsum** has improved my website design massively. Here's three reasons why:

* Design looks more professional and bespoke. You're probably charging the client a lot more than the cost of a stock template, so don't make it look like one.
* It forces you to acquire a deeper understanding of the client's business. To design *their website* you should be able to quickly write sample headlines, navigation, and micro-copy specific to them (not necessarily good copy – but relevant copy). Not only does this help you nail the design, but is also impresses the client and ensures their confidence in you.
* Considering words is important. Sometimes they will be long and if the final content doesn't fit into your design – that's your fault. There are always reasonable limitations to content length. With a design that considers this from the start the boundaries will be understood and worked around by both designer and client.


These benefits are invaluable to a successful project. Any misunderstanding of the brief and client are caught *early*. It's perfectly fine to clear things up in the first design meeting, it's not so good when the website is being built and populated.

I still use Lorem Ipsum from time to time. It's useful for showing large paragraph designs like a blog post (where writing the whole thing would be silly). I just make a point of testing the design through extremes of short and long content.

Do **you** design with Lorem Ipsum? Leave a comment! Let me know your experience.
