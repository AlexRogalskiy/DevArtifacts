title: Is it Time to Realign?
---

Every so often I get the _designers itch_,

Obviously, I'm referring to the need to redesign my whole website and personal identity.

After realising how much time that would take (a lot) and how much time I have (none) I opt for a realign to fix some short comings of the old version. It also allows me to try out some experimental web design "techniques" that aren't quite ready for client work.

For a long time I've been wanting to integrate a feed from my other blog [Design Heroes](http://www.designheroes.co.uk/), and my current design just doesn't suit extra content. Since I've recently been invited to the [Carbon Ads](http://www.carbonads.com) network I think the ads deserves a consistant placement. My portfolio needs some attention too.

This time I'll be looking for a format that is truly on par with modern website design. It's going to be responsive, accessible and something special, something that I won't get bored with a year later! I want to offer a tailored browsing experience for all devices. It's not going to be hugely different in aesthetics, I love whitespace and my [green crane](http://www.dbushell.com/)!

Deadline? As soon as I can, without rushing into anything.

Advice? Let me know! What does a web designer need to prove these days?
