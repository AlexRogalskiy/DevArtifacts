title: In Search of the Perfect CAPTCHA
---

I've been on quite the journey over the last few weeks...

...searching for the perfect CAPTCHA!

You can read my findings over at [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/04/in-search-of-the-perfect-captcha/) – big thanks to the team for their support and guidance in writing this article – I'm still immensly honoured! It's also been quite an eye-opener to the issues of accessibility. That's something I'm going to focus on more strongly in future web design projects.


<blockquote><p>The human brain is an amazing piece of work. Its ability to conceptualize, to find order in chaos and to adapt under extraordinary circumstances makes it highly useful, to say the least. For some tasks, it outshines a computer with great ease. In other tasks — mathematics, for example — it is laughably inferior.</p></blockquote>


I've also removed the CAPTCHA from this blog. I suppose I had to :)
