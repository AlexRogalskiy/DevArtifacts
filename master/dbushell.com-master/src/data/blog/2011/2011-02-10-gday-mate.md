A wonderful package arrived on my desk this morning!

It contained the [CSS Awwwards book](http://www.thecssawards.com/blog/best-css-websites-book-2010.html) from [The CSS Awards](http://www.thecssawards.com)* honouring the best CSS Websites of 2010 - that's a lot of CSS!

**I'm Mr July 9. **It makes me happy but humbled, especially sat next to [The Mid-Century Modernist](http://www.midcenturymodernist.com/) - a site far more worthy of such an accolade.

I also learned today that I'm Australian! I had no idea, my [home page](https://dbushell.com) says I'm from the UK. Oh well guess I can't complain, I will learn to embrace my new heritage.

Better photos to come when I have more than my iPhone at hand.
