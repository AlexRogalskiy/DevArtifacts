As most people know I don't 'do things by half' and taking on ambitious projects is generally how I role these days. (Not Sunday though, I refused to take things serious on Sunday.)

Last week I launched **[xheight.dbushell.com](http://xheight.dbushell.com)** as a blog for many more designers than just myself to discuss the theory of design from experience and aspirations.


<blockquote><p>**xheight** aims to share the inner-most secrets of professional designers. On one hand, this blog will allow its authors to understand their own discipline, but more importantly, it will allow others a new perspective on what design can mean.</p></blockquote>


As expected it's had a very positive reception, and why wouldn't it? Nothing helps us more in design than studying the approach of others. **xheight** is focusing on theory over practical techniques which for some is a difficult concept to grasp. Their loss!

Keep an eye out because there are some great designers lined up to share their ideas. I'm very grateful to all who are participating – thanks guys!

Oh, and follow [@xheightblog](http://twitter.com/xheightblog).
