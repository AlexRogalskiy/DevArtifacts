title: Inspire me now!
---

There are many things that inspire me – some I'd be embarrassed to admit! – but a combination of graphics, typography and a great quotation is certain to be a winner.

I've never really been a quote type of person though, because my memory isn't geared to remembering that sort of stuff.  I even set up a website ([Kwibit](http://kwib.it/profile/dbushell/)) to keep track of "memorable" or inspiring things I've read online.

Nevertheless, whether I choose to store quotes in my brain or a database, there's nothing quite like a limited edition print to get my designer senses tingling!
