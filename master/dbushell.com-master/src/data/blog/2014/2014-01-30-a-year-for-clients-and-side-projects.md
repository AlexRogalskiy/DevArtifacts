title: A Year for Clients and Side Projects
---

_It's been a slow start to the year — my internet access is peaking at 15kb/s for the time being — so if you're reading this, I've got through!_

Working freelance for most of last year was very rewarding and I'm glad I made the jump. I want 2014 to be a year for both perfect clients _and_ personal side projects.

I'll be announcing my first project towards the end of Feb (as soon as I'm back online). If you're interested: **[sign-up for my newsletter](http://eepurl.com/M2I9P)**. You'll only receive at the very most one email per month. Thanks for your support. I'll of course be blogging about projects too (long live [RSS](/rss/)).

And if you're looking for an experienced designer / dev to guide you through the website making process; I'm always [open to new clients](/contact/).

That's all for now!
