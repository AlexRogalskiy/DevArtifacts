For the last few weeks I've been working on a little project that I'm excited to announce. That project is called [Tales](http://themes.dbushell.com/tales/) and it's available today.

<p class="b-post__image">[![Tales WordPress theme preview](/images/2014/02/tales-preview-large.png)](http://themes.dbushell.com/tales/)</p>

**[Tales](http://themes.dbushell.com/tales/)** is a responsive WordPress theme tailored for a beautiful reading experience. Its strength and design principle can be summed up in one word; simplicity. Visit the [Tales Demo](http://themes.dbushell.com/tales-demo/) website to see a basic install in action.


## Typography


What makes Tales so special? First and foremost the theme has been designed with an unwavering focus on content and readability. Tales CSS makes use of `em` units for all sizing and media queries. This ensures font size honours the user defined browser setting and everything scales proportionally (see: [“The EMs have it”](http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-ems-have-it-proportional-media-queries-ftw/)).


## Mobile and Legacy Browsers


Tales has been built on solid foundations. A top notch experience is in store for the latest browsers. More importantly older versions like **IE7**, **iOS 3.0**, and **Android 2.2** aren't far of the pace.

And my all time favourite browser, Internet Explorer 7:

Not too shabby, right?


## Responsive Design


There's not a great deal to write about here that you can't [see for yourself](http://themes.dbushell.com/tales/). The style of navigation is a notable choice. I decided to go fixed and off-canvas to give unity across all devices. I find it works very well for Tales' blog format where long, individual pages views are common.

The design aligns to two complimentary grids and a loose baseline within the main content. Five major breakpoints were used to adapt to screen size.
