Spring means several things to me: Easter, the conclusion of the football league, and the annual tradition of refreshing my personal website design. This year is more pertinent than usual being one year since [I started freelancing](/2013/02/04/a-new-home/).

## No More Logo


I've ditched my logo. It was large and a little out-dated. I work independently, my name and face are my brand alongside my design aesthetic, so why do I need a logo too?

My [origami crane](/showcase/origami-unfolded/) is another signature image. One that's more attractive, versatile, and a piece of my design portfolio I'm especially fond of. Allowing this to become the primary visual focus has given my home page a new beautiful simplicity.

Practically speaking the logo was unwieldy to design around. If an unimaginative person were to write _“The Laws of Web Design”_ one might state _“the logo must appear in the top-left corner”_. Such boring convention encourages an equally unimaginative masthead to follow suit. By freeing myself of these constraints I became open to much more experimental ideas.


## Readable Content


I adapted the fixed header concept I first developed for my [Tales WordPress theme](/2014/02/17/introducing-tales/). It provides instant access to navigation and a subtle reminder of who I am. Importantly, it doesn't dominate the top of every page. On larger viewports the website footer becomes a fixed sidebar off to the right. This brings my profile and recent content into view while allowing the current page to lead.

Whilst tidying my web server the other day I noticed that my [original portfolio](/origami.html) from 2008 is still online. Look at how tiny that text is! My eyesight has no doubt deteriorated since, but my respect and understanding for web accessibility has increased at a far greater pace. With each iteration of my website I've strived to improve typography and reduce content density. I reckon this is my best iteration yet.


## Coming Soon…


I'm still waiting for a few websites to launch before I update my [design portfolio](/showcase/) with more recent responsive case studies. I'm hoping for a big summer update.

I'm also writing a front-end dev review to cover technical aspects of my new website. Expect that sooner!
