v1.1 of my [Tales WordPress theme](http://themes.dbushell.com/tales/) includes a new Spanish translation.

Many thanks to [Mike Walsh](http://imaginalgo.com/) for contributing the translation and adapting my theme for his own website Imaginalgo — looks great!

See my blog post [“Introducing Tales”](/2014/02/17/introducing-tales/) for more information about the theme.
