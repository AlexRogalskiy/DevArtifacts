I'm back in the office and feeling positive about this year's work.

[Give me a shout](/contact/) if you require my web design / front-end skills. I've been thinking long and hard about the type of work I'd like to take on, and really, I find a variety most rewarding. It's nice to alternate between design and dev.

For the last few months I've been deep in code, working hard behind the scenes. So what I'd love next is a nice little visual portfolio piece.

New Year's resolution? Probably to be more social. I've got my eye on [DotYork](http://dotyork.com/conference). Ticket bought for [UpFront Conference](http://upfrontconf.com/).

See you soon!
