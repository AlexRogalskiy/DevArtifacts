My website navigation now links to my [GitHub](https://github.com/dbushell/) and [CodePen](http://codepen.io/dbushell/) profiles, alongside [Twitter](http://twitter.com/dbushell/). A long overdue change. It was embarrassing to be rocking the Google+ link. I never used Google+, I don’t even use Facebook, but it was useful to get my face alongside search results. That feature disappeared some time ago and thus the link follows suit.

I was delighted to find both [GitHub](https://github.com/logos) and [CodePen](http://blog.codepen.io/documentation/brand-assets/logos/) provide detailed brand asset pages with vector logos and guidelines. This should be standard for any organisation. Though I suppose most people will still use Google images to find a saved-one-to-many-times JPEG… oh well!

Anyway, I’m looking to take on work for July / August onwards so [get in touch](/contact/).
