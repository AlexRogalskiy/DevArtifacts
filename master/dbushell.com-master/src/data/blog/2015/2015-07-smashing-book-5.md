Last week I had the opportunity to read [“Real-Life Responsive Web Design”](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/07/finally-smashing-book-5-is-here-and-its-hot-like-smoking-barrels/), the fifth book in the Smashing Book series.

Usually with books like this I will skip to the chapters that immediately catch my eye. This time was different, they all sounded fascinating — and they were! I read the book cover to cover in two sittings.

<p class="p--light p--small">Disclaimer: I was given the book for free with no strings attached. I’m under no obligation to review the book or write kind words, these are my genuine opinions.</p>

As with all books in the series, this book collates the red hot topics that are defining front-end development in 2015 and the foreseeable future. The content is conference level of quality in detail, research, and delivery (and I’ve seen many of the authors speak).

I’ll highlight a few chapters I see myself referencing often:

In “Performance Optimization Roadmap”, **Vitaly Friedman** recalls the on-going development of [smashingmagazine.com](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) since its 2012 redesign. It’s one thing to preach best practices, but to implement them with limited resources on a website of such scale is challenging (to say the least!)

**Sara Soueidan** has written an outstanding reference for SVG usage in her chapter: “Mastering SVG For RWD And Beyond”. I honestly thought I knew it all but even I learnt a new technique. If you’re not using SVG yet this chapter will set you on the path.

In “Building Responsive Components With Flexbox”, **Zoe M. Gillenwater** covers many real-world use cases for Flexbox whilst documenting the technical details. Flexbox is impressively versatile for implementing responsive layout. Again, if you’re not familiar with the spec — and importantly, what it can do — start your journey here.

It’s not often I read a book twice but I’ll definitely be going back to re-read these chapters. They’re packed.

So, good book? Yes, very good!
