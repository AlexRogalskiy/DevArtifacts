Good afternoon! So it’s been a while since I last blogged. Turns out buying a home takes longer than I imagined!

[When I left London](/2012/12/30/a-new-beginning/) in 2012, I moved back in with my parents  (temporarily) to embark upon a freelance career. Work has been steady, not easy, but rewarding and I’m much happier out of the “Big Smoke”.

This April I started flat hunting around Manchester. The whole process has been time consuming and work has suffered a little bit. Today though I’m finally settled. Broadband is fast,  [the office chair…](https://twitter.com/dbushell/status/633916401061896192) well it encourages me to stand up every 30 mins to stretch my legs. I’m now in a position to take on longer projects and plenty of availability in the coming weeks.

**Looking for a design / front-end dev freelancer**? [Get in touch.](/contact/) I’m excited to see what you’re working on! Now that I’m in Manchester I can work from local offices if you prefer. My banter is a bit rusty but I make a good cup of tea.
