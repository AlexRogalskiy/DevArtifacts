Today I started a new project. **Macaque** will be a personal to-do or list app. Sounds simple, right? Unlike my other side projects I'm coding and designing in public from day one.

This project exists because:

* I want to learn more [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Ember](http://emberjs.com/)
* I've failed to find a list app I like (oh lord, please don't suggest one)
* I'd like to _own_ my data and 'reinvent' the list app experience (for myself)


If you care you can follow my [progress on GitHub](https://github.com/dbushell/Macaque). I'm keeping the features stupidly simple because there is already so much to consider.


## Starting point


I've played with Node before but I'm starting Ember development with a blank slate. This weekend I've been casually introducing myself.

While I dived into Ember routes and templates I threw together a quick [Express](http://expressjs.com/) app to serve fake API data. I feel comfortable with that now. I can see a list of tasks! The next step is add, edit, and delete functionality. That means going back to data storage and a real API. I want to do this quickly because it's not my main interest.


## Moving forward


Once the API is ready I'll return to Ember and implement the functionality. For UI design I'll start with either [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) so it's not ugly. I'll be designing the final interface as I learn Ember and will eventually throw out the framework and rebuild the HTML & CSS from scratch. The interaction design I'm envisioning will require advanced Ember concepts (I expect) so it will be useful to having a basic version in place first.

I plan to publish everything under the MIT license prior to implementing my advanced design. I think it will be a helpful review project for future beginners.

And if I get that far? I'm plotting the heinous crime of parcelling the website in a native Android wrapper and installing it on my phone.

Words cannot express how happy that would make me.

Before I continue with any of this I need an icon! If you see me tweeting a poorly traced Macaque face, this is why. If you too are interested in Ember, aside from the oficial docs, Robin Ward (Evil Trout) has a great [Ember series](http://eviltrout.com/2013/02/27/adding-to-discourse-part-1.html) on his blog.
