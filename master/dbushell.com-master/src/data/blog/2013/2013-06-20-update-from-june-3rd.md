title: Update from June 3rd

I received a shout-out in the "hot drama" section of [Shop Talk Show (E073)](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/073-with-val-head/) — bucket list _checked_, I love those guys — however my point was somewhat missed I feel.

On June 3rd I wrote an article entitled [The Raster Image Paradox](/2013/06/03/the-raster-image-paradox/) which prompted a response from Tim Kadlec on [Why We Need Responsive Images](http://timkadlec.com/2013/06/why-we-need-responsive-images/) — which I agree with 100% — and also Shop Talk Show host Dave Rupert who wrote [“Ughck. Images.”](http://daverupert.com/2013/06/ughck-images/)

Both of whom make perfectly valid points around two contradictory concerns. The concept of a responsive image implementation in the browser would allow two main abilities:


* To serve smaller images to smaller screens to save bytes downloaded
* To serve high definition images to high-PPI screens for better visual quality


These ideas are often at odds. No technology can find the appropriate line between performance and quality. This is a human decision that we should already be making _today_.

Let's say a responsive image patch lands in the next set of browser updates — what's changed? We'll have more flexibility sure, but when we weigh up the pros and cons we'll end right back in the middle. I guess it's fair to say I'm "throwing in the towel" — but only on a silver bullet.
