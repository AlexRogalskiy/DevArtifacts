You may have caught my [recent experiment](/2012/12/22/a-responsive-off-canvas-menu-with-css-transforms-and-transitions/) — well I've gone and written a very thorough examination for **Smashing Magazine**. Read my latest article: “[Implementing Off-Canvas Navigation For A Responsive Website](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/15/off-canvas-navigation-for-responsive-website/)”.

I do enjoy writing for @smashingmag. They're genuinely some of the nicest people ever to email me. As [I leave London](/2012/12/30/a-new-beginning/) this year I plan to dedicate more time to long form articles on the big stage, while reserving this blog for quicker, more frequent updates.

[Mark Boulton](http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/shorterlongform) recently said:


<blockquote><p>I’d like to see more balance again. More short, scrappy blog posts (like this one), written off the cuff and in the moment. Sometimes, I’d like to read the author’s actual voice, instead of a homogenised edited one. There has to be a space between 140 characters and 3000 word feature.</p></blockquote>


— and I for one am happy to oblige.
