Nobody said microcopy was easy...

While catching up with my Twitter feed I follow a link to Google+ — appears to show signs of life within the tech community — and I'm greeted with this wonderful message:

<p class="b-post__image">[![Google plus nonsense](/images/2013/11/google-warning.png)](/images/2013/11/google-warning.png)</p>

**_"Your profile has been suspended because it impersonates someone."_**

A straight up accusation of potentially illegal acts. There's no ambiguity, I'm guilty until proven innocent. I don't pretend to be an expert in the field of user experience but I do know a thing or two about _common sense_. This is an appalling notification to throw in your user's face. It raises the question, just who wrote this message? a designer? an engineer? the legal department? — if it was a _copy writer_ I've lost all hope.

I tried to reach out to Google+ with my obvious concerns (and disgust) but I require an active Google+ account to post to the [user group](https://plus.google.com/communities/115758385206378551362). Oh well.

It should go without saying that website users are humans. Design and build with empathy. Especially if it's a website you're trying to force down our throats.
