Now that I'm officially a [self-employed freelancer](/2012/12/30/a-new-beginning/) I plan to blog more frequently. In the past I've rarely written very technical articles, but I imagine there are many designer/front-end developer types like me who struggle with this stuff. Tomorrow I'll post a big responsive design case study, I promise.

Today I moved my private code repositories onto **[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)** — my personal WordPress theme and other "secret projects". I don't have the disposable income anymore for premium accounts! I'm keeping my [open-source projects](https://github.com/dbushell) on GitHub (while it remains fashionable). 


## Multiple SSH keys


Problem is, Bitbucket doesn't allow you to use the same SSH key with more than one Bitbucket account. I still have my old work account to tidy up loose ends.

As [GitHub explains](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) you can generate an SSH key like so:

````
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"
````

You are then prompted for an optional password. After the key is generate you copy & paste it into your GitHub or Bitbucket account settings. On Mac OS X (10.8), which I'm using, copying to the clipboard is simple:

````
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
````

With multiple Bitbucket accounts (and I assume GitHub too) you need multiple SSH keys. To generate a second key with a different name:

````
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/accountB -C "your_email@youremail.com"
````

To use multiple keys create a file at `~/.ssh/config` with contents similar to:

````
Host bitbucket.org
  User git
  Hostname bitbucket.org
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host bitbucket-accountB
  User git
  Hostname bitbucket.org
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/accountB
````

With this set up I can clone with my default key as Bitbucket suggests:

````
git clone git@bitbucket.org:username/project.git
````

If I want to clone a repository from my second account I can alter the command to use the second SSH key I generated:

````
git clone git@bitbucket-accountB:username/project.git
````

In fact, if I wanted to I could have a different SSH key for every account I have; GitHub, Bitbucket, or any other service that requires one.

And that, my friends, is the sum of my knowledge in this area!
