I've written loads about [my flat build process](/2013/04/05/the-flat-build-2/), [automation](/2013/03/12/automation/), [browser support](/2013/04/26/on-browser-support/) — in fact, if you follow me on Twitter you'll know I can't shut up about the Web. What I've been lacking is a canonical resource for my work beyond theoretical writing and live production examples. Despite web standards being open they aren't always easy to reverse engineer.


## What is Origin?


Starting a new project for me used to mean cobbling together and rehashing code from past work. This year I started to consolidate everything into my own personal boilerplate to kick start front-end development.

"Origin" is my code name for this on-going project (everything needs a name). It's not a behemoth of code like [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). It's specifically tailored to suit the websites I make. It will never be complete and it will evolve dramatically as my preferences and needs change.

This is not a framework I expect others to use 'as is' but I decided to make it public because:


* A lot of people asked kindly
* I learn from similar projects by other developers
* It will serve as a reference point when discussing particular techniques


If you care to poke around the [code is on GitHub](https://github.com/dbushell/dbushell-Origin). Or you can see the [GitHub page](http://dbushell.github.io/dbushell-Origin/) for my starting [pattern library](http://dbushell.github.io/dbushell-Origin/origin.html). This doesn't include everything I consider a "best practice" and a lot of things aren't commented. Make of it as you will — just please don't include it in a _"10 new resources for developers"_ blog post!

If you like the idea of automated builds and need a mature Grunt workflow then give [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) a test drive. For a BEM-style CSS framework there's [Inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css). And if you need to prototype something fast, Bootstrap and Foundation have their uses.
