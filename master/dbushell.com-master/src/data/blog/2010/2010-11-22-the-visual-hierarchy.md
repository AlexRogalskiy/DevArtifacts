I've written a little web design article for [Base Creative](http://www.basecreative.eu/news/david-bushell/2010/11/22/the-visual-hierarchy).

Here's a snippet:


<blockquote>There is more to design than making things look attractive and truth be told that’s the easy part. In regards to web design the actual aesthetics of a website have very little bearing on its success. Style is superficial and becomes more subjective the heavier it is applied. [...] a website user will make a split second reaction concerning their interest in a website. Therefore it is very wise to plan the structure of content. We must acknowledge what the user is looking for and make sure they see it.</blockquote>


Read the juicy parts of [The Visual Hierarchy](http://www.basecreative.eu/news/david-bushell/2010/11/22/the-visual-hierarchy) over on the Base Creative blog.


### More!


I realise I don't blog enough about website design! Should I be writing more? I'm rather pleased with this article and plan to turn it into a mini-series.

I blog at [Design Heroes](http://designheroes.co.uk) daily with interesting bookmarks. It has a small following on [twitter](http://twitter.com/dsgnheroes) and RSS but I continue it as a personal reference most importantly. Perhaps I could be doing more there? Sometimes I have a lot to say, other times I don't.

Anyway, hope some of you find my latest article useful!
