title: Summer of Design Heroes
---

The trouble with writing for two design blogs is that all the positive stuff tends to drift towards one of them (especially when it's called [Design Heroes](http://designheroes.co.uk/)).

So in an effort to balance the love I present a run down of all the brilliant creativity I've been blogging about over the last few months.


### Favourites of June


[Hayaku: A Time Lapse Journey Through Japan](http://vimeo.com/12112529) - In the summer of 2009 Brad Kremer shot a series of time lapse videos around Japan's urban and rural areas. The result is this stunning, beautiful and tranquil video.

[I'M COMIC SANS, ASSHOLE](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/monologues/15comicsans.html) - Mike Lacher delivers an hilarious monologue embodying everyone's favourite typeface, Comic Sans.

[Retinart](http://www.retinart.net) - The blog of Alex Charchar, an Australian graphic designer with a passion for exploring and reflecting upon creativity.


### Favourites of July


[The Mid-Century Modernist](http://midcenturymodernist.com) - a website dedicated to the inspiration of the modernist art movement between 1945 and 1970. The latest update is a great feature on the TV show Mad Men.

[Andrew Kim](http://designfabulous.blogspot.com) - An incredibly talented young product design student. I predict a very bright future for this kid! The next Jony Ive?

[Yiying Lu](http://www.yiyinglu.com/) - graphic designer and illustrator, famous for creating the twitter "fail whale". Her work maintains a level of sophistication while remaining colour and full of life.


### Favourites of August (so far)


[Bradley Castaneda](http://twentyfivethree.com/) - a US designer and photographer from the greater Seattle area demonstrating professional talent in both photography and graphic design - one of the exceptional few!

[Christian Knopf](http://www.christianknopf.de) - the fantastic multi-discipline portfolio of a German based art director and designer. His website is a perfect example of combining Flash and web standards to create a visual and accessible portfolio.


### And a shout out to...


This summer has also been a wonderful few months for my personal website (dbushell.com). I've been featured on many websites including [The CSS Awards](http://thecssawards.com/), [Web Creme](http://webcreme.com/), [The Design Inspiration](http://thedesigninspiration.com/) and [Design Shack](http://www.designshack.co.uk) to name drop a few!
