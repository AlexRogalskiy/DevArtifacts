Look what arrived today!

**Typographic Conundrums** by _Harry Pearce_.

[*photo was lost to time...*]

This awesome little book is full of typographic conundrums that need to be visually decoded into revealing a common saying or phrase. Very clever in their wit and simplicity.

I was lucky enough to attend Cumbria University where Harry Pearce was asked to give a talk. He showed off some of these conundrums and (when asked in the Q&A;) said he wasn't planning to publish them! Can you believe that? I bet he changed his mind after years of nagging.

[Buy the book on Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Conundrums-Harry-Pearce/dp/0061826596/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1263908328&sr=8-1).

Pearce will be speaking on the 19th Jan in Plymouth. [More info here](http://www.shellsuitzombie.co.uk/shellsuitzombie/2010/01/harry-pearce-the-designers-society-plymouth/).
