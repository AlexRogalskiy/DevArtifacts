title: Photoshop like a Real Designer
---

There has been a lot of debate recently in the web design social networks about whether a web designer should be able to code. I didn't contribute much to the question because the answer is **obviously yes**, but I did think long and hard about my own practices.

Today Smashing Magazine published a great article by Thomas Giannattasio, [*"In Defense of Photoshop"*](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/07/29/in-defense-of-photoshop/). He raises the point that:


<blockquote><p>Photoshop can be used to create impeccable designs, but after hours of hard work, you end up with a static mock-up that is incapable of emulating the experience one gets when the design is converted to mark-up and viewed in the browser.</p></blockquote>


And this would be my main point if I were to articulate an argument on why web designers should be able to code. Simply put, if you can't code and don't understand HTML and CSS - **you are not designing a website**.

In the article linked above Giannattasio makes an excellent feature suggestion for Photoshop allowing users to *'shop* semantically closer to the DOM and CSS properties available. I don't know why Adobe haven't been innovating features like this for years. It would definitely aid those '*web designers*' who can't code. It would simplfy things for pros too but in truth a professional web designer should be able to:


* Keep a running mental visualisation of the DOM as the design evolves.
* Understand the limitations of HTML/CSS and browser quirks.
* Know exactly what mark-up and styling will be needed to create each element.
* Know exactly how raster images will be implemented.
* Know exactly how the page is going to flow and transform at different resolutions.


If you can't do these things you are not designing a website. **Don't blame the tools.** While the CSS idea in Photoshop could be helpful it isn't necessary (or relevant to the software). You should already know what techniques to use to mimic CSS (hint: *blending options*, not *filters*).

There are many comments on Giannattasio's article suggesting that 'design' should be an entirely different step to 'development'. From the clients point of view this is true but from a production point of view it doesn't really matter. If you know how to build a website you can design one freely in whatever software suits you.

**Understand development and you can realise greater potential with design.**
