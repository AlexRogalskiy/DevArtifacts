Man, this month has been hectic!

[*photo was lost to time...*]

When I'm not at work I'm busy trying to finish an in-depth article on the future of interactive design (featuring the iPad :-). The delay might be a good thing because there has been a some excellent articles on the subject in the past couple days so I'll have a few more points to dicuss, when I get round to it!

Annnnyway. Tonight I visited the [Matt Stuart](http://www.mattstuart.com) photography exhibition at the [KK Outlet](http://www.kkoutlet.com) (Hoxton Sq, London). It's the [first thursday](http://www.firstthursdays.co.uk) of Feb but I stuck to the one gallery this time (and not the usual gallery-slash-pub crawl). Did I say Thursday and pub in the same sentence? - diet coke of course.

Go check out Matt Stuart. There's something about his work that just makes you smile.
