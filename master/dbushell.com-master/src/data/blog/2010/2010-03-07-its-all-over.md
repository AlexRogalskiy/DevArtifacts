I started the daily photo project back on the 1st January (obviously) with plans to take a photo every day until 2011. Things were going well, that is until day 61. About 12 minutes after midnight I realised in a state of panic/relief that Day 60 did not have a photo.

It's surprising just how disappointing I felt. Failure is not an option with me, but until I invent a time machine I'll have to admit defeat. It would be easy to blame a combination of busy work, ill health and moving flat  for missing Day 60 - so that's what I'm going to do.

Anyway, it has been a worthwhile project and if anything I finally built up the motivation to go out and buy a decent camera. _And_ learn how to use a camera.

I'll still be taking daily photos when it takes my fancy.

[*photo was lost to time...*]

And I've also got a slightly more [insane project](/2010/02/18/1000-cranes/) on the go...
