Living in London has its advantages, but the environment and fresh air aren't on that list.

I was beginning to forget what the colour green looked like! That's why it's nice to return home from time to time. This time I returned home with my [new camera](/2010/02/14/olympus-e-p1/) which has sadly been in storage more often than not since I bought it. But I gave it a good walk today to make up for it.
