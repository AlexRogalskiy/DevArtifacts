Last year I started the bookmarking website [Design Heroes](http://designheroes.co.uk) to share and remember design related links, a kind of "inspiration blog". It has served me very well in those occasions where I can remember a resource or piece of design I want to reference but have no idea where it is. The old design worked great for that but it wasn't very accessible to other people, so I decided to redesign it.

### New Design

The new site retains the idea of "tag filtering" but is initially presented in a more recognisable blog format. The big different is a large image assigned to every bookmark. To maintain a minimalist feel, various elements are hidden and can fade in when needed. Let me know what you think!

Another cool feature I added is navigation by arrow keys (up/down). The final big change is the ability to post a comment on each bookmark. Hopefully this will make the site a lot more engaging.

And finally, [Design Heroes is on twitter!](http://twitter.com/dsgnheroes) So go follow.
