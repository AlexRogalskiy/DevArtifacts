I stumbled across one of Apple's classic ad campaigns. Watch Jobs pitch it below:



<p class="small">Found this via [Young Guns vs. Old Ones](http://www.younggunsvsoldones.com/2010/08/31/steve-jobs-think-different-pitch/).</p>

Inspiring, and a masterpiece of advertisement.

Makes me wonder how differently Apple were thinking when they announced [Ping](http://www.apple.com/itunes/ping/) their new social network for music.

Despite [championing HTML5](http://www.apple.com/html5/) it would seem Apple have now decided a web browser (even Safari) is inferior to the almighty monolith that is **iTunes**. Ping is completely walled off. Why it doesn't have a web interface I have no idea. It's social without the riff-raff. Or Apple-friendly mainstream artists without the indie bands.

The problem with the interface of iTunes Store & Ping is that by all accounts it generally sucks (ignoring Steve's opinion). It doesn't behave or interact in the same way as a website. But it _should _be a website. Instead it's confusing, fiddly, tedious, awkward; proprietary nonsense. **Now that is thinking differently.**

To quote Apple on HTML5:


<blockquote><p>These web standards are open, reliable, highly secure, and efficient. They allow web designers and developers to create advanced graphics, typography, animations, and transitions. **Standards aren’t add-ons to the web. They are the web.** And you can start using them today.</p></blockquote>


**"Standards aren’t add-ons to the web. They are the web."** But apparently not good enough for iTunes and Ping? I guess those two are just add-ons then. Only available in certain countries.

Good job Apple make awesome ads.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to play Angry Birds on my iPhone. For four hours.
