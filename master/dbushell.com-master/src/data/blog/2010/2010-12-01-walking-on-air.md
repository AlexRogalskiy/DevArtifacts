I'm in a genuinely positive mood this evening, partially because **dbushell.com** survived another automatic WordPress update* but mainly because my MacBook Air arrived today!

Since this is the first laptop I have ever owned I'm not going to write a comprehensive product review but I'd like to point out a few things that are brilliant:


* The multi-touch pad works amazingly well. It requires a physical click down so no amount of heavy finger tapping will trigger a click. That has plagued all my brief laptop relationships to date. I can normally click a laptop just by looking at it.
* The 1440x900 resolution packs an impressive 128 pixels per inch. It takes a little getting used to compared to my 24" iMac which is only 94ppi. Everything is so small and crisp!
* It's fast. Zero to Photoshop faster than I can tweet about Adobe jumping the shark. The real test will be when I use it as my primary photo editor over the holidays.


13-inch with 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD (by the way). I didn't upgrade the storage because who needs that kind of data on a laptop? Probably me I'll no doubt find out, but I have plenty of storage elsewhere if needed.

I'll be sure to post an update after using this for a few months. I just remembered I'm suppose to be [designing a font](/2010/11/07/the-typographic-gauntlet/), so if you'll excuse me.

<p class="medium">* updated to 3.0.2 without bricking the whole website like 3.0 did, fun times!</p>
