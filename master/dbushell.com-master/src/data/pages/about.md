Based in the UK, somewhere near Manchester, I design and build websites as a freelancer for people all over the world.

If I gave myself a job title I suppose it would be _Websitemaker_. It gets straight to the point. While I specialise in design and front-end, my experience and knowledge covers a whole lot more. So if anyone asks, tell them [I make websites](/services/).

## Experience

Prior to my freelancing life, immediately after graduation, I worked in London's East End for five years for two digital agencies. I quickly moved into a senior client-facing role being responsible for all front-end code and design on many projects.

During this time I worked with just about every client imaginable from the public sector departments to the small local businesses. I found that a personable and attentive approach to discussing a client's business instilled trust. Rather than trying to "sell" a website design I'd involve clients in the process to design it alongside me.

I went freelance early 2013 and kicked things off by speaking at the [Responsive Day Out](/2012/12/07/responsive-day-out/) conference. Since then I've provided my design and front-end development skills to many web agencies and clients.

On the Web, I consider myself self-taught. Programming has fascinated me since the days of dial-up modems and floppy disks (this domain is over a decade old). My formal education is firmly rooted in the finer arts. I graduated with 1st class honours in Graphic Design at Cumbria University.

I write about the web on [my blog](/blog) and shares ideas, inspiration, and nonsense [@dbushell](http://twitter.com/dbushell). I've also written [articles](http://smashingmagazine.com/author/david-bushell/) for industry leader Smashing Magazine. I host several popular [projects on GitHub](https://github.com/dbushell). You can find me on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/dbushell/) where I play around with code.

## Philosophy

I create things for the web with longevity in mind. Designing for the future is profitable and leaves a lasting experience. While I'm not modest about my professional skills, what I pride myself in the most is the collaborative and thoughtful process I bring to my clients. This is the most enjoyable part of my job.

## Public Speaking

On March 1st 2013 I spoke at the [Responsive Day Out](/2012/12/07/responsive-day-out/) conference in Brighton, UK. My profile photo was taken by [Marc Thiele](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcthiele/8519276774) during my talk.
