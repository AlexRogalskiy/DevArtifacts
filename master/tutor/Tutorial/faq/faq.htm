<BR>PhotoLine 32 has so much functions that the tool bar would not be large
enough. So we made icons with a little red point on the bottom right side.
This icons have several functions. Click on the icon and hold down the
left mouse key for a second. A popup appears and you can select the function
you want.

shows not the normal tools like brush and rubber, what can I do?</B></FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">PhotoLine 32 only shows that tools, which can be used with the current layer
tool. If a text layer is active, you don’t have access to the drawing tools.
If you can’t find a certain tool and you have ensured that it isn’t a multiple
icon, check, whether you have selected the right layer.</FONT><BR>

in PhotoLine 32 shows values in pixel. But I want other units like inches.</B></FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">You can change the units of every size field and of the rulers in PhotoLine 32.
Right-click (on Windows) or Ctrl-click (on Mac OS) on the field and you will
get a popup with the selectable units. You can do this also with the font size,
but here you have to right-click on the arrow beside the value on Windows.
You can calculate in all fields with units.</FONT><BR>

<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">4.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> I want to
crop an image, but I don't know how this works.</FONT></B>
<BR>First of all you have to create a lasso around the area that you want to crop.
Then you press "Crop" in the Tool Settings or in the context menu. You can
create a "Soft Edge" with the corresponding setting in the Tool Settings.
If you hold Shift while cropping, the cropped area will be shown in a new
window.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">5.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Starting PhotoLine 32 From An USB-Stick</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">You can start PhotoLine 32 from an USB-stick without any problem. First you
have to copy the installed PhotoLine 32 folder from your harddisk to the
USB-stick. Now you can start PhotoLine 32 from the USB-Stick, but the
settings are still saved to the harddisk. In order to fix this, you have to
create a folder named "UserSettings" in the PhotoLine 32 folder on your
USB-stick. On Windows the "UserSettings"-folder has to be directly in the
application folder, on mac OS it must be in the application package in
"Contents/Resources". If PhotoLine 32 finds "UserSettings" on starting, it
will read and write its settings to it.</FONT><br>

<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">I want, that using the rubber makes the image transparent. How do I do that?
The rubber usually uses the background color. But if an image has an alpha
channel/transparency, using the rubber makes an image transparent. An alpha
channel/transparency is created by the function Layer Properties. In this
dialog there is a switch named Use Transparency which allows to both create
and remove an alpha channel/transparency.

plug-in filters is correctly specified at "Options/Extended/Plug in Moduls" and 
the filters are set active. The filter files have an "8bf" suffix. If your filters
