And that's how I like it. It's etymology is derived from _metaphysics_ or _metaphysical_, but twists the highfalutin philosophical concept and makes it all cuddly and cute with a bubbly adjective.

Of course, using _Meta_ in the name isn't too original for a web business. Let's see, there's... 

+ The everlasting social network [Metafilter](http://metafilter.com)
+ Awesome web design agency [MetaLab](http://www.metalabdesign.com/)
+ Social game shop [Meta+Level Games](http://metalevelgames.com/)
+ Several entities all known as _Metaform_: [two product](http://www.metaformdesign.com/) [development shops](http://www.metaformstudio.com/), [a synth-rock band](http://www.metaformonline.com/), and a [hip-hop producer](http://www.myspace.com/meta4m)

Visually, the word has a good shape. Two ascenders and one descender make for a nice [bouma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouma).  Plus with that _&#64257;_ in the middle, I get a sweet ligature that'll tickle the ribs of any typophiles (more on that in another couple posts).

Naming a new endeavor is always sort of a hassle. It should be short, catchy, and generally relate to the product or service your pushing. But as a web-property, not only do you need a good name, you run into issues with availability for domain name or usernames like for Twitter. In my case, both metafizzy.com and @metafizzy are already taken. But I'm okay with sacrificing the untarnished username and .com domain in favor of a name I like. After all, if your service is good enough, people will find you.

When kicking around product ideas at [nclud](http://nclud.com), I feel like we can get too wrapped up in finding the perfect domain name. Even worse, we start devising the best short URL for our imaginary service. It's like in high school, when you really wanted to start a band. So you start scribbling out names of your imaginary band. Then you start sketching logo concepts. When the entire time you should have been practicing guitar and writing songs.

So be sure to come out to the San Dimas High School Battle of Bands this Friday night, where my act <em class="metafizzy">Metafizzy</em> will be taking on last semesters champs, *Wyld Stallyns*.
