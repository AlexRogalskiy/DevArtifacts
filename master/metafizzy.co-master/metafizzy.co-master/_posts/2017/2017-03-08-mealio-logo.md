_If you eat and if you even remotely like food then [Mealio](https://www.mealio.com) is the right place for you._ Mealio helps people solve the problem of constantly having to create a weekly meal plan by generating them based on the user's preferences. It's like Spotify for food.

I was tasked to design the Mealio logo. I delivered on an friendly & clever M monogram that evokes the approachable and helpful qualities of Mealio. The fork and knife fitting within the counters of the M say it all. Knife, fork, M = Mealio.
