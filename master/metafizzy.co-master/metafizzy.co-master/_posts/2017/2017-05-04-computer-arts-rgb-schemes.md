As part of their March 2017 issue on VR, [Computer Arts](http://www.creativebloq.com/computer-arts-magazine) featured the [RGB Schemes logo](/blog/rgb-schemes-logo) in a five page spread. I got to share the nitty gritty of how the project came together, working through the brief, and all the stuff that didn't make the cut. [You can still grab a back issue online](https://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/design/computer-arts-magazine-back-issues/computer-arts-march-2017-issue-263/).
