Today, Metafizzy is releasing a [brand new version of Infinite Scroll](https://infinite-scroll.com).

Infinite Scroll automatically adds next pages, saving users a full page load. For a decade, it's been a premier JavaScript plugin and a significant part of the web. After going quiet for a couple years, we have taken over the project from [Paul Irish](https://paulirish.com)'s stewardship and brought it in to the Metafizzy product family.

Infinite Scroll v3 is a complete re-write that brings lots of great, new features:

+ **Back and refresh button friendly**: Version 3 [upholds URLs by changing them](https://infinite-scroll.com/options.html#history) as the users scrolls. No more tears when you scroll 20 pages and accidentally hit refresh.
+ [**Masonry, Isotope, and Packery**](https://infinite-scroll.com/options.html#outlayer) integration.
+ Package management support for [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/infinite-scroll), Yarn, [Webpack, Browserify, & RequireJS](https://infinite-scroll.com/extras.html#module-loaders).
+ **Vanilla JS** support.

As a Metafizzy product, Infinite Scroll v3 has all the features and benefits you've come to know and expect: easy-to-use, powerful to extend, with a robust API of options, methods, and events.

Infinite Scroll has been near and dear to my heart since I was first learning JavaScript. I'm delighted to be bringing it back to life.
