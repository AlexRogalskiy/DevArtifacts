[Sunset Spark](http://www.sunsetspark.org/) is a technology and science school in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, NY. They teach new American families all the subjects I would have devoured as a kid: robotics, creative coding, game development. [Just take a peak at their Insta](https://www.instagram.com/SunsetSparkNYC/). I'm proud to have designed their new logo.

The double-S and bolt logo is a nice balance between approachable/fun and professional/serious. The bolt is front and center. The S's take a back seat formed by the bolt and the outlines.
