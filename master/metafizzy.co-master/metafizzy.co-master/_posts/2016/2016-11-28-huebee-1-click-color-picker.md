I've made a new thing! [Huebee is a one-click color picker.](http://huebee.buzz) It displays a limited set of colors so users view all colors at a glance, make clear decisions, and select a color with a single click.

I made Huebee while I was working on [Logo Pizza](http://logo.pizza). I added a feature so you can choose your own custom colors for a logo. Looking at other color pickers, I couldn't find what I wanted.

Most color pickers are computer-centric. They are designed to display and select from every possible color available, nearly 17 million. But as a human, you only need a good selection: maybe 6 hues, with several shades, plus a couple grays.

That's what Huebee does ‚Äî show a limited set of colors so its easier to make sense of them.

Huebee is Metafizzy's 4th commercial library. The other libraries, [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co), [Flickity](http://flickity.metafizzy.co), and [Packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co), are all big, full-featured projects. Supporting them is a lot of work. Huebee mixes that up. Huebee is small and purpose-built ‚Äî a welcome entry in the Metafizzy product line-up.
