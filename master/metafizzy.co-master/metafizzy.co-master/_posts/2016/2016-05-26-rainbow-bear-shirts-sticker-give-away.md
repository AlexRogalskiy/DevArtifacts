## Rainbow bear shirts now on sale

[Metafizzy rainbow bear shirts are now on sale on Cotton Bureau.](https://cottonbureau.com/products/fizzy-bear) You can now sport that fizzy bear, bouncing up towards design Valhalla, right on your own person. **The sale lasts for the next two weeks, [so order now](https://cottonbureau.com/products/fizzy-bear).** We'll throw in a couple stickers with your shirt to sweeten the deal.

Shirts come in Poly-cotton Bondi Blue, Apple Green, and Heather Gray. 3 lovely options to choose from, in both men's and women's sizes. Poly-cotton shirts are soft to the touch, are a couple bucks cheaper, plus have a better true-to-size fit. Tri-blends might feel super soft, but I suspect they're designed with malnourished vagabonds in mind. No way I should by hulking-out of a medium. Not a problem with the Poly-cotton. If you're a medium, order a medium.

Yeah, the design happens to be the logo for Metafizzy. But when you put on this shirt, it's just a rainbow bear. No explanation required. I've left off any other workmarks or branding, to let the design be itself. Just a bear, leaping for kicks, all rainbowed out. [You'll love this shirt.](https://cottonbureau.com/products/fizzy-bear).

I'm selling these shirts with zero markup. Just like a proper mattress store, passing the savings on to you. I've been working with Cotton Bureau for years and have consistently been impressed with their quality of product. Great to launch another piece of apparel with [the gang in Pittsburgh](https://twitter.com/metafizzyco/status/716671120146087937).

But the swag don't stop there...

Whew, that's a lot of goodies! [We haven't done a sticker give-away for three years](/blog/sticker-give-away/). Been too long! I'm finally in a place where I can spend time mailing stuff out. That's the real constraint. Sitting down, printing envelopes, heading to the post office. It's great to now have an option for all the good people outside of the States. [The response to the new logo was a treat](https://twitter.com/metafizzyco/status/712281507289640961), so I'm jazzed to get these out there.

And when you do get your rainbow bears, why not scratch our back and [show off the goods like these fine folks](https://twitter.com/metafizzyco/timelines/676774542568726528)?
