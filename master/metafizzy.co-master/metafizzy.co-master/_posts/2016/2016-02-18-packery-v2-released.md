title: Packery v2 released
---

[Packery is our fantastic bin-packing layout library](http://packery.metafizzy.co), first released 3 years ago. Packery can do something no other library can: draggable grid layouts. But Packery's dragging behavior had plenty of quirks: random movement, potential gaps. It worked, but it wasn't pretty.

So we fixed it. Dragging with Packery version 2 has been completely re-tooled.

</div>

It feels much more intuitive. Now dragged items fit to their drop position. No more random movement. Packery v2 is perfect for draggable Masonry layouts and draggable dashboards. We put together a fun drag & drop puzzle to show it off (with a prize!).

What else is new? We dropped IE8 & 9 support for 25% smaller filesize, new [shiftLayout method](http://packery.metafizzy.co/methods.html#shiftlayout), simplified [Webpack integration](http://packery.metafizzy.co/extras.html#webpack), and more. Plus [completely refreshed docs](http://packery.metafizzy.co) with individualized demos and [CodePens for every feature](http://codepen.io/desandro/pens/tags/?grid_type=list&selected_tag=packery-docs).

Already have a Packery v1 license? Keep an eye out for another email from us for a big discount to upgrade to v2.

Packery v2 is an awesome upgrade. Just one of several that will be happening in 2016. Up next: Isotope v3 and Flickity v2.
