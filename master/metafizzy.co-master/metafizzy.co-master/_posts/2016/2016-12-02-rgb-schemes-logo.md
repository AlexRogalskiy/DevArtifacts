I designed the logo, type treatment, and brand guidelines for [RGB Schemes](http://www.rgbschemes.com/), a VR gaming start-up. Woo, it's a fun one! The main logo is the RGB birdie, a symbol dense with meaning.

+ Bird for fun and whimsy
+ R, G, B letter shapes
+ Letter shapes in isometric view for 3D & VR graphics
+ Additive color blending displaying red-green-blue color space

The kicker: The birdie can be rendered as a 3D object.

I coded up this demo with 3D CSS transforms so you can [drag around the logo for yourself](http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/LRXkQY/).

It was one of those wonderful cases of design happenstance. I put the letters in a cube and kept playing around with the arrangement. At one point, I spot: "Hey, that kinda looks like a bird." Sometimes you get lucky ;)

Here's a look at all the explorations designed in the effort.
