Last year my buddy Andy reached out to design the logo for [300 Optimist Park](https://www.300optimistpark.com/) a new apartment building going up in Charlotte, North Carolina. We worked together, looking at local type, trying out fonts, eventually honing in on the final design as a set of 3 wordmarks in 3 color palettes. One year later, the building is up and ready to rent. That sign is my first physical signage ever to go up (a proud moment).
