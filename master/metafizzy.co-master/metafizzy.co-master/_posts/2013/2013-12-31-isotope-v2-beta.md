[Isotope v2 beta](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/beta) is out! Version 2 is a big upgrade:

+ Way better support for responsive web design with [element sizing options](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/beta/options.html#element-sizing).
+ Custom CSS no longer required.
+ jQuery no longer required. Isotope works with vanilla JavaScript.
+ [getSortData shortcut strings](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/beta/sorting.html#getsortdata).
+ Integrated masonry features like [`stamp` option](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/beta/options.html#stamp) and [centering with `isFitWidth`](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/beta/layout-modes/masonry.html#isfitwidth)
+ AMD support

The beta is released so you can get aquainted with the new version before I flip the switch. As a user, you probably [won't have to change much to use v2](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/beta/appendix.html#upgrading-from-v1). This is a beta, so feel free to [submit new issues you come across](https://github.com/desandro/isotope/issues/new).

Happy 2014!
