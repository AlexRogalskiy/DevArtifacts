Making money with open source software is weird. Metafizzy's products are very much open and available. You can use them, read their docs, and inspect their source code, all without any barriers. Open-source is a great practice for front-end development because it matches so well with the open nature of the web. Front-end code, by its own definition, is in the front. You can see it. By being visible, front-end code This principle of visibility encourages sharing ideas.

My own advancement as a developer can be largely credited to open source.

The release of [Flickity](http://flickity.metafizzy.co) v1, [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co) v2.2 and [Packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co) v1.4 comes a better licensing model.

Metafizzy's business model relies on a simple premise: My work is worth something. As work

Metafizzy's business model relies on a simple premise: My work is worth something. In any other industry, you can easily equate that worth with a price. If you're a shoemaker, you make a shoe. If someone wants that shoe, you sell it. But with front-end

The release of Flickity v1 also saw the release of Metafizzy's improved licensing model.

Metafizzy's business is based on a simple premise: my work is worth something. In most other professions, you make money by selling a product. If the customer wants the product, they can aquire it by exchanging something of value, typically buying it with money. With front-end development this kind of exchange doesn't make sense. Front-end code, by its own definition, is in the front. The customer already has it. Instead of selling the product, Metafizzy's business model works by selling the license to use the product.

Over the past years, I've experimented

Admittedly, this model feels complicated and weird. A license for usage is an abstraction of the product. It doesn't have the same grounded feeling of exhanging money for a product.

One way to address this would be to treat Metafizzy's products like a typical products. Put them behind a glass case. You would be able to see them, but you couldn't touch, couldn't inspect, and couldn't play around with them for yourself. I've considered this solution, but ultimately, I feel it betrays the spirit of the Web. Front-end development is great because of its openness. My own advancement as a developer can be largely credited to the Web's open nature. Keeping Metafizzy products open source is more valuable than raising paywalls. So licensing it is.

Over the years, I've tried several licensing models. The first started with the ideal as free for open source use, pay for commercial use. As Isotope and Packery's popularity grew, so did the number of questions around the licensing model. I tried to resolve these questions by adding standardized licenses like MIT and GPL. But this lead to more complications and conflicts. Read over the discussion in GitHub issues [metafizzy/isotope#800](https://github.com/metafizzy/isotope/issues/800) and [metafizzy/packery#212](https://github.com/metafizzy/packery/issues/212).

> Ideally, I want Isotope's licensing model to:
>
> + Make Metafizzy money
> + Be easy to understand. Provide a clear value so that people feel okay about purchasing it.
> + Allow for open-source development. No pay-walls. All code on GitHub.
> + Allow for as much usage as possible. Do not limit where Isotope can go.
> 
> Isotope originally was not associated with a specific license when I first released it. I got several requests to license it so it could be included with Wordpress.org, which requires GPL-compatible. I first tried adding "a MIT license if you're not commercial" statement, but eventually switched to GPL. Both have received the same feedback, that the licenses have a conflict with the over-arching stipulation. 

I needed a lawyer.
