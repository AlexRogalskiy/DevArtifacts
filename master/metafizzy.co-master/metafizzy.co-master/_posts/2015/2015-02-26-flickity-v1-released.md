## How much does a widget cost?

Now that it's been properly launched, it's worth considering what it cost to put it all together. In the development of Flickity, I have produced:

+ Behavioral prototypes
+ Robust API for wide-scale use
+ Unit tests
+ Several dependency libraries, like [tap-listener](https://github.com/metafizzy/tap-listener) and [fizzy-ui-utils](https://github.com/metafizzy/fizzy-ui-utils)
+ Add-on libraries like [flickity-imagesloaded](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity-imagesloaded) and [flickity-as-nav-for](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity-as-nav-for)
+ [A complete documentation mini-site](http://flickity.metafizzy.co)
+ Multiple development blog posts
+ [Unit demos](http://codepen.io/desandro/tag/flickity-docs/) for every feature
+ Support, [addressing open source issues](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/issues)

Flickity's total development time, from [initial demos](/blog/initial-demos/) to v1.0.0 release, has taken about 3 months. [Creating Isotope](/blog/isotope-v1dot0-released) and [Packery](/blog/packery-released) took about 3 months as well, although I wasn't working on them full-time. Estimating that a front-end developer's yearly salary is $100,000 (which is on the low end for NYC or San Francisco), 3 months would cost $25,000. 

A widget costs 25 grand. That's to say, a full-featured widget with all the bells and whistles like Flickity costs 25 grand.

This may sound extravagant. But consider that if for each of  [Flickity's thousand GitHub stars](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/), it saves one person one hour of work, that would be 1,000 hours. If the average hourly rate for each person is $50:

<pre>1,000 hrs &times; $50/hr = $50,000 total value</pre>

I could argue that work put into Flickity costs half of what it's worth. When you consider the aggregate benefits that they can provide, the value of widgets is tremendous.
