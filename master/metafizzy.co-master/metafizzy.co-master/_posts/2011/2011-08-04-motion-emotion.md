A couple weeks ago, I spoke at Aol HQ about animation in web design. I took the opportunity to discuss some of the inner logic within Isotope, and how you can use it in your own applications. You can view the presentation outline, which has demos and code examples throughout: [desandro.github.com/motion-emotion/](http://desandro.github.com/motion-emotion/). Inside you'll also find  the technique I use on this site for the transitioning link color.

My thanks to [Nate Eagle](http://twitter.com/neagle) and [Dave Artz](http://www.artzstudio.com/) for the invitation, and for the sweet hoodie that I wear this moment as I write this post.
