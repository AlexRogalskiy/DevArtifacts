Yay, I'm getting married in a month! Between getting all the final details together, going on a honeymoon, and my full time job, I have no bandwidth to take on any support requests. So I'm taking off support service until December 2011. I apologize for the lapse in service and wish you the best of luck debugging your way out of the trenches.

Have a spooky Halloween and scrumptious Thanksgiving!
