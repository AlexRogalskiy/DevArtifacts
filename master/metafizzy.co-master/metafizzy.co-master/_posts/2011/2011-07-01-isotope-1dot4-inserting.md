I just pushed up a bunch of commits earlier this week for Isotope v1.4. Features include a refined animation when inserting or appending new items and official support for shuffling order. If you're too lazy to try out inserting in the [Adding items demo](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/demos/adding-items.html) and shuffling in the [Elements partial demo](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/demos/elements-partial.html), here's a quick video that exhibits both new features.
