Earlier this year, .net magazine published [Get started with jQuery Masonry](http://www.netmagazine.com/tutorials/get-started-jquery-masonry), a terrific tutorial article by [Luke Shumard](http://lukeshumard.com/).

> Luke Shumard provides a crash-course in David DeSandro’s Masonry, a jQuery plug-in that’s ideal for both novice and intermediate web designers

I was happy to recommend Luke to write the article. As the developer behind the engaging fashion culture sites [Dazed Digital](http://www.dazeddigital.com/) and [Satellite Voices](http://www.dazeddigital.com/satellitevoices/), Luke has more production-level experience with Masonry than anyone else I know.
