This is a story of serendipity.

But first, may I present Metafizzy's new logotype, designed by [James T. Edmondson](http://jamestedmondson.com/).

Deep within the core of every graphic designer burns an yearning for creative typography and custom lettering. We all want to be [Jessica Hische](http://jessicahische.is/awesome/), [Erik Marinovich](http://friendsoftype.com/author/erik/), and all the other [Friends of Type](http://friendsoftype.com/). Having already produced [several](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=duke) [compelling](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=wisdom%20script) [fonts](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=lavanderia), boasting a [wonderful Dribbble showcase](http://dribbble.com/jamestedmondson), and backing it all up with a captivating portfolio, Mr. Edmondson belongs in this pantheon of typography superheroes.

So I was totally thrilled to when James reached out via email, notifying me that he was using [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co) for [his new site](http://jamestedmondson.com/). This was probably the closest I'll ever get to quenching the envious thirst to make pretty type. The use of Isotope was compelling -- an organic grid layout, using filtering to showcase similar content.

But after taking a look at the source, it was apparent that, while James was an incredible typographer, his jQuery skills were still developing. In addition to thanking him kindly for sharing, I replied back with some recommended code refactoring. Thus, the gentlemenly gesture was returned, and a mutually-respectful working relationship was born.

Metafizzy was already in business for a year. It was time for a proper brand identity. My own attempts at a logo were perhaps cute, but ultimately immature in communicating the spirit and values of the company.

I had been considering contracting a proper typographer for a while to work on a custom logotype. But, lo and behold, a talented letterer contacts me before I even begin searching! It was kismet!

What followed was an enlightening exchange working toward the final product. Here I was, playing the role of the whiny client who thought he could "design" and do some sketching of his own.

After suppling the aesthetic inspiration of "rainbows and super-powered teddy bears," James produced these first five sketches.

I was floored. Any of those five sketches was a winner. But there was something about the fourth sketch that jumped out as "this is an identity."  I tried to play around with some sketching of my own.

To which James came back with:

I tried a [bunch more sketching](http://imgur.com/a/Z9x1T), but these were all dead ends. From James' sketch above, it was just a matter of honing it in.

James was so awesome, he made a geometic alternative and a one-line variant.

I couldn't be happier with the results. James totally delivered on the work and then some. He was a pleasure to work with and you should go [hire him right now](http://jamestedmondson.com/#about).

A logo is both important and unessential. You can spend a lot of time on it, but that time is probably a lot better spent on building any other part of the business. 

But I can say, now that Metafizzy has a proper logo, it does feel significant. This whole venture feels legitimate and worthwhile, all because I have something I'm proud to put on a t-shirt.
