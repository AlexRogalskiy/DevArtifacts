# promise-use-cases

Short lived repository in order to discuss Node.js promise use cases in Collaborator Summit Berlin 2018

The goal is to provide feedback to Node.js and V8 in order to possibly expose APIs to add capabilites. The goal is explicitly not to address things that can be done in userland. 

This is to discuss diagnostic/debugging experience that could be done better.

Please see [the meeting discussion](./meeting-discussion.md) for current use cases we have.

### Contributing

Please consider making a pull request for that are confusing with promises right now or are done better in userland. I will present the results (with your name and contribution) to Node.js core.

You can also open an issue if you prefer!

**No prior Node.js contribution experience required**. If you're a user of promises and thing we should do things better - we would love to hear about your use case.
