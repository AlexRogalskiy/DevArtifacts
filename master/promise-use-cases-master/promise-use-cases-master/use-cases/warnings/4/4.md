### Use Case #4

Name: Promise constructor allows for Promises that never resolve.

Consider the following code

```js
;(new Promise(() => {})).then(() => console.log('a executed'))
;(Promise.resolve('x')).then(() => console.log('b executed'))

// outputs
// b executed
```

### What happens

The first Promise (`new Promise(() => {})`) will never resolve or reject. 

### Why it happens

It is possible to create a Promise using the Promise constructor which does not resolve or reject (by never calling `resolve()` or `reject()`)

### What can we maybe do better

- Provide a warning when neither `resolve` or `reject` are referenced in the promise constructor.
- Optionally provide a warning when a Promise remains alive for more than N seconds and was neither resolved nor rejected.
