### Use Case #2

Name: Forgetting to `await` promises in `async` functions.

Gal is writing code with Promises. He is writing the following function, but it doesn't work as expected.

```js
async function manipulateUsers() {
    const users = getUsersFromDatabase(); // Note, no await
    for (const users of user) {
        doManipulation(user);
    }
}
```

### What happens

An error is thrown.

### Why it happens

Gal forgot to `await` the promise, making `users` be of type `Promise<ListOfUsers>` and not `ListOfUsers`, Promises are not iterable.

### What can we maybe do better

Provide a clear warning when Promises are created within an async function, but are not being `await`ed.
