### Use Case #1

Name: Forgetting to return promises from `then` handlers or `async` functions (when not awaiting)

Paola is writing code with promises, she has written the following function which is supposed to connect to the database and fetch users - but the function does not work as intended:

```js
getInitializedStat().then(() => {
  getUsers(); // note this is missing a return
}).then(users => {
  res.json(users);
});
```

### What happens

Instead of returning the users - `undefined` is returned.

### Why it happens

Paola forgot to `return` the promise in a `then` chain.

### What can we maybe do better

User libraries like bluebird give warnings in this case because a promise is created in a `then` handler but is not returned.
