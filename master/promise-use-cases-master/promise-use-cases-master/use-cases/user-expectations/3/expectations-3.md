### Use Case #expectations-3

Name: Promise queue documentation

Eva wants to learn how Promises integrate with the general flow of the event loop, and what is the order of execution of Promises relative to everything else.

### What happens

Eva can't find official documentation or sources that explain this.

### Why it happens

Because Node didn't write one.

### What can we maybe do better

Provide official documentation on the order of execution with regards to Promises and other async tasks like timers.
Provide technical guides on how the code works inside Node.js.
