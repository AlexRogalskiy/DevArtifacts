###Quiz 


**1. What is a `normalize.css` file?  What does it do?**

`normalize.css` is a pre-written CSS file tha that is used to: 

* Preserve useful browser defaults rather than erasing them.
* Normalize styles for a wide range of HTML elements.
* Correct bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
* Improve usability with subtle improvements.
* Explain the code using comments and detailed documentation.

**2. What are Bootstrap, Html5 Boilerplate and Zurb examples of?  Why would you use them?**

These could all be considered examples of front-end frameworks. While it depends who you talk to, in my opinion, HTML5 boilerplate (H5BP) is more of a lightweight and very minimal starting template/outline aimed at setting you up for following design standards and best practices (e.g., includes `normalize.css` from #1) but without imposing much additional on a developer/designer. This, in part, diverges from the more the more robust and structured front-end frameworks that include Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation. I'm partial to Zurb's implementation because it's lighter, being developed for mobile first, but both provide a more or less modular framework of html, styles (via LESS or SCSS), and jQuery/javascript plugins aimed for developers to customize (or potentially not) to the degree of their liking.

**3. What does Gridulator do?  How would you use it as a web developer?**

Gridulator is just a tool to help you set up your own grid system for css. You have to still translate it into your css code, but it helps with calculations after setting the size of your content area.

**4. What's a good reference to see all the tags available in CSS?  Paste a couple of good references below:**

[Mozilla Developer Network CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)

[w3schools.com CSS3 Reference](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_browsersupport.asp)

[css3.com](http://www.css3.com/)

**5. Where is a good place to find and use web fonts?  How do you integrate a font into your web page?**


**Free**

[Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)

[Adobe Edge Web Fonts](http://html.adobe.com/edge/webfonts/)

[Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) + [WebFont Generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator)

**Paid**

[Typekit](https://typekit.com/)

[FontDeck](http://fontdeck.com/)

**Best option**: Linking to an externally hosted style sheet in the head of your html document e.g., 

````
<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Code+Pro' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
````

**Alternatively**, using `@import` in your css file

````
@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Code+Pro);
````


**6. What is a hexadecimal color code?  Write out some hexadecimal equivalents to common colors.**

CSS colors are defined using a hexadecimal notation (6 alphanumeric characters) for the combination of Red, Green, and Blue color values (RGB). Here are some less common, but pretty :), colors:

**7. Using what you know about hex colors, guess what this color may be: `#FAF3BC`. (Hint: What do higher numbers like `FF` mean in relation to the color that is associated?)**

It would be on the lighter (closer to white, `#ffffff`)

**8. Padding and Margins - what are the difference?**

*CSS box model*

padding extends the content area upto border while margin with empty space while margin extends outside the border with empty space between the element and adjacent elements. 

![CSS Box Model](http://demosthenes.info/assets/svg/box-model.svg)

**Note:**<br />
*width + padding + border = actual visible/rendered width of box*<br />
*height + padding + border = actual visible/rendered height of box*

**9. Explain what this syntax is this: `.btn:hover`.**

This is css for a class selector with a pseudo-class specifiying that this style definition will apply to the element of class `.btn` on state, hover. 


**10. Explain what happens to an element that has the styling `margin: 10px 0 20px 0`.**

With 4 values, CSS shorthand for padding and margin specify `property: top right bottom left;`, so this would style the element with a 10 pixel margin on top and a 20 pixel margin on the bottom, with 0 margins to the right and left. CSS shorthand can further reduce definitions with the same value for right and left, such as this: `margin: 10px 0 20px`

Borders, backgrounds, fonts, and lists all have common shorthand notations. This is a good reference for these syntax specifications.

**11. Compare CSS classes to CSS idâ€™s.** 

html elements (tags) can have both **class** and **ID** _attributes_ (0..1 id; 0..* classes per tag).

**id attribute**

* a way to style **a specific element from CSS**
* specifies its _unique identifier (ID)._ can be used for: 
* a way to link to specific parts of a document using fragment identifiers
* a way to target an element when scripting


**class attributes**

* specifies a style for a group of elements
* affects class matching in selectors in CSS
* the `getElementsByClassName()` method in the DOM
