#Proud Moments in Code
My proud moment in code is from week 6 and the challenge *Create a Car Class from User Stories*. 
<br>

>**Overview**<br>
In previous weeks, you've delved into object-oriented programming in various ways. You've created a class based on pre-defined driver code and user stories. You've converted a functional program into an object-oriented program. You've also created driver code to interact with an existing object's class.

>In this challenge, we're going to tackle the trickier task of creating a class with only user stories by taking a real world object and translating it into ruby.

>**Learning Goals**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify the attributes and methods of a class based on user stories<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Create driver code based on simple instructions<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Develop great names by creating good driver code<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Devise a methodology for building class structure<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Bonus:** Design classes that communicate and relate to one another

I'm proud of this code because I pushed myself (with the help of a DBC coach) to go beyond my comfort zone and learn new aspects of ruby and OOP in general. I felt that I definitely got a lot out of this challenge.

# DRIVER CODE
# ------------

#Instantiate Pizza Delivery Car
car = Car.new('black', 'Lamborghini', 'Murcielago', 4)

#Instantiate pizza order #1, add options, add to car's pizza compartment
order1 = [pizza1 = Pizza.new(8,'gluten-free'), pizza2 = Pizza.new(12,'pan')]
pizza1.options {pizza2.special_instructions = 'extra well-done, please'}

car.load_pizza_compartment(order1)
#Instantiate pizza order #2, add options, add to car's pizza compartment
order2 = [pizza3 = Pizza.new(16,'thin crust')]
pizza3.options('extra cheese') {pizza3.special_instructions = 'go light on the sauce, please'}

car.load_pizza_compartment(order2)

#Route to first delivery
route = [['drive', 0.25, 25], ['stop', 'stop sign'], ['turn', 'right'], ['drive', 1.5, 35], ['drive', 0.25, 15],
         ['stop', 'stop sign'], ['turn', 'left'], ['drive', 1.4, 35], 'delivery_destination']

#Instantiate trip, travel & delivery pizza
trip = Trip.new(car, route)

#Print any remaining pizzas for delivery
puts "\nWhat\'s left?"
car.get_remaining_pizzas.flatten.each {|pie| pie.display_pizza}



# REFLECTION
# ----------------------
# I was able to work with a guide on this exercise during a pair when my partner didn't show up. He
# was extremely helpful and I appreciated that he further pushed me to make this problem more
# challenging. The things I liked most about this challenge was getting to use the #send method and
# additional practice with blocks and yield. I can definitely see how the #send method will be a
# useful tool in the future. I need to move on from this challenge and work on other ones but if I
# was going to refactor this further, I would like to implement a hash for passing the arguments to
# the Car class. I'm going to try that type of approach on another challenge and maybe I can come
# back to this down the line and shape things up a bit more! 

# I tried to work on my 'confident code'--and coerce when in doubt (e.g., line 123 @route =
# Array(route)), but it's definitely difficult for me as I tend to write more timid code and am not
# 100% clear on all the ins and outs of confident code, assertive code, duck typing etc.
