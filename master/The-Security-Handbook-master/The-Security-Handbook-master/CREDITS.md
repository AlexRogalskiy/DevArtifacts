This repo was originally started by frizb under a different intention and title before a DCMA request against the original repo caused it to be removed. I'm unsure of the nature of the removal but anticipating that it was due to answers to OSCP lab questions being implied throughout his original content I have aimed to move this back into a more generic guide. Changes from November-2017 heavily reflect this change but a large portion of original works should be attributed to frizb.
