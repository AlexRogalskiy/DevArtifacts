## Starting Web Maker

**Web app**

**Chrome extension**

Once the Chrome extension is installed, you'll see a Web Maker icon in the right-top of your Chrome browser. Click it and Web Maker will open in a new tab.

## Your first code

Okay, so now you might be wondering what do I do with Web Maker open in front of me? Wait no more! Simply put, Web Maker lets you write HTML, CSS & JavaScript code and see instant preview. So lets write some code.

You should be seeing 3 code panes with the headings: **HTML**, **CSS** and _JS_. Each code pane is dedicated place to write code in the respective languages. Go ahead and click inside the **HTML** code pane to focus it and then paste the following HTML code:

```html
<h1>My first HTML</h1>
```

As soon as you paste the code, you should see the preview of your HTML in the white preview area.

This is a very simple web page we just made. Going forward, you might need to put CSS and JavaScript too. You can write them in their respective code panes and see instant preview.

## A look at the user interface

Web Maker's user interface is made to feel simple and accessible so that you have all the required things at your tips and still doesn't look cluttered for someone using it for first time.

### Code Panes

Code panes are the actually sections where you write your code. You get 3 panes, one for HTML, CSS & JavaScript each.

### Preview

Alongside the code panes, is a white (by default) area where you see the preview of your code. Its an iframe that is feeded your HTML, CSS & JavaScript as you type to generate realtime preview.

### Title

On the top-left side you can see the title of your creation. Click on it to edit it anytime.

### Create New, Save or Open a creation

On the top-right side, you have the 3 buttons to create a new creation or save an open one. Also you can access all your saved creations from the _Saved Creations Pane_ by clicking the _Open_ button.

From the _Saved Creations Pane_ you can also export or import all your creations at once. Exporting generates a JSON file which you can backup in your Google Drive, Dropbox etc.

## From the Developer

Hi! I am [Kushagra Gour](https://twitter.com/chinchang457), a frontend developer from India. I created Web Maker as a side project from myself because I wanted a frontend playground that was fast and didn't have to rely on network latency to generate realtime preview. Also something which I could use whenever and wherever I wanted, even wihtout Internet! I have written articles about why and how I created Web Maker and how you can benefit from it as a developer.
