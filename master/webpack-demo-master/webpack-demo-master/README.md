#Webpack Demo

This is the webpack demo from survivejs.com.

*Webpack simplifies web development by solving a fundamental problem - the problem of bundling. It takes in various assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and then transforms these assets into a format that's easy to consume through a browser. By doing this well, it takes away significant amount of pain from web development.*
