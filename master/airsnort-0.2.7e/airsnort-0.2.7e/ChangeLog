01/09/05
* Cleaned up defines in PacketSource and callbacks
* Fixed endian issue for identifying unique IVs in korek.c
* Added check to prevent call to stopMonitor when packets
  are read from a file.
* release 0.2.7e
01/07/05
* Added SNAP detection as an indicator of a properly decrypted
  packet.  This is a workaround for instances in which the 
  WEP ICV is not computed correctly.
* Release of version 0.2.7d
01/05/05
* Fixed some endian issues to enable proper execution on PPC.
12/27/04
* Fixed integer overflow problem found by Caz
* Fixed numerous problems with save/restore of options
12/23/04
* Changes to Windows code to handle packet format returned when
  using DWL-650 drivers.
12/19/04
* Better handling of Korek attacks though still no user interface
  for specifying parameters.  Default fudge factor is 2.  Running
  cracks are aborted and new cracks started for each 256k packets 
  recieved.
12/18/04
* Added Korek/Devine aircrack style attacks.  Attacks are done
  in real time while airsnort collects the packets.
* Fixed code to handle Orinoco EN10MB reporting problem
09/21/04
* Improved Windows stability. I have actually done a successful
  crack with this windows code!
* Various stability improvements including elimination of some
  memory leaks and more reliable file handling.
09/05/04
* Modified Windows support
* Release 0.2.5 with limited Windows suport
* Compiled windows binary now included with release.
03/17/04
* Added conditional around IW_MODE_MONITOR
* Stopped using prism headers with wlan-ng drivers
* Fixed declaration of fs in callbacks.c/loadFile to work with
  older C compilers
* Finally removed gnome dependencies (I hope)
02/19/04
* Added support for latest orinoco (cvs) drivers which provide
  support for monitor mode via iwconfig
* Bug fix to make device dropdown work properly, Refresh button
  fixed
* Changed driver type drop down to reflect HostAP support
  (which works the same as the latest orinoco drivers, both are
   handled by: iwconfig DEV mode monitor)
* Release 0.2.4 - Works with latest orinoco drivers
12/31/03
* Added last packet time of receipt to statistics and display.
  I am not really happy with the time format which is straight
  from ctime.  Suggestions anyone?
* Made all columns in the display area resizable
* Fixed problems with modal lockout in save packet confirmation
  on exit

12/30/03
* Release 0.2.3b - bug fix release
* Fixed crashes associated with file open operations
* Deleted a few dialog boxes defined in airsnort.glade in order
  to do all file selection operations programatically

12/07/03
* Updated glade file to glade-2
* Rewrote gui components to use GTK 2.2
  - THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED IN A WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT

11/09/03
* man pages now install with a 'make install'
* Incorporated faq into CVS
* Fixed compile problem for gcc 2.95.4 centered around 
  FrameControlZero union declaration

08/17/02
* Bug fixes.
  - fixed CRC checking problem in checkKey
  - fixed CRC mismatch between orinoco and prism cards
* A crack attempt is now made when breadth is changed.  Previously cracks
  were tried only with each 10 new interesting packets
* Fixed bugs in gencases and decrypt that prevented decrypt from decrypting
  gencases files and airsnort from cracking gencases files

06/07/02
* Fixed bug that caused tens of thousands of false IVs to be reported as
  weak
* Added orinoco_hopper to the distribution
* New version of decrypt will take a key file as input to perform 
  dictionary style key guessing

05/20/2002
  Reworked the glade file to remove gnome support in the hopes that
  greater compatibility is achieved.  gtk+1.2 is still required.

New in v0.2.1
* Packet capture is done using libpcap. THIS MEANS NETLINK SOCKETS ARE
  NO LONGER SUPPORTED.  This primarily affects users of older wlan-ng
  drivers. For wlan-ng users, you must use a patched 0.1.13 driver, or
  a 0.1.14 or later driver.
* It should be possible to use ANY card that passes monitor mode packets
  up via the PF_PACKET interface. For wlan-ng and patched Orinoco drivers
  airsnort will do automatic placement into monitor mode and channel scan
  at a 0.2 second interval. For other cards, like Cisco, you will need to
  manually place the card in monitor mode before airsnort will see any
  packets. Orinoco users MUST use the the *-packet-* Orinoco driver
  patch available at http://airsnort.shmoo.com/orinocoinfo.html
* Minor user interface changes to bring common options to the main page.
  The preferences dialog is gone.  Options are saved and loaded from
  .airsnortrc in your home directory.
* Airsnort can save packets in pcap dump format
* Airsnort can read pcap dump files
* The gencases tool will generate encrypted packets using weak IVs, and
  save them to a pcap format dump file.  Load the file with Airsnort to 
  observe it crack the password.
* The decrypt tool opens a pcap dump file and decrypts all packets 
  associated with a specified AP when supplied with the proper password.
  decrypted packets are saved to a new pcap dump file. As an option, 
  beacon packets can be filtered out of the output file.


New in v0.2.0:
 
* Packets are sorted based on the SSID of the associated AP, allowing
  packets from several APs to be captured simultaneously without 
  hindering the crack operation
* Cracking is attempted in parallel with capture.  There is no need to
  guess whether you have enough packets to obtain a successful crack.
  Packet capture for a given AP terminates when that AP is cracked.
  A couple of cracking parameters are configurable in the Preferences
  dialog.
* The GUI may be a bit buggy as I did not take the time to learn about
  using GTK in a mutli-threading environment.  If anyone wants to look
  into improving reliability I am all for it.
* An increased set of IVs that result in a resolved condition is 
  accepted.
* airsnort sets the channel to sniff on via direct communication with
  the nic.  There is no need to place the card in promiscuous mode
  prior to starting airsnort.  Also, airsnort now has a crude channel
  scanning capability built in.
* Orinoco WaveLAN/IEEE cards are now supported, via a patch to the
  orinoco_cs driver (actually the orinoco.o module) available for
  the pcmcia-cs-3.1.31 source.
* Wireless device name is configurable in the Preferences dialog.
* It is even possible to start a session w/ a prism2 nic, pause it, 
  swap to an orinoco nic, and resume the session, without exiting
  airsnort.
* The PF_PACKET interface available with a patch to linux-wlan-ng-0.1.13
  and expected to be available in 0.1.14 is supported with a radio
  button in the preferences dialog.  The patch is available here
